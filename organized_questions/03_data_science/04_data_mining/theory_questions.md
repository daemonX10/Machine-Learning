## Question 2

**What is the difference between data mining and data analysis?**

**Answer:**

Data mining is automated pattern discovery from large datasets using algorithms, while data analysis is the broader process of inspecting, cleaning, and modeling data to draw conclusions—often with human-guided hypothesis testing.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Data Mining | Data Analysis |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Approach** | Algorithm-driven, automated discovery | Human-driven, hypothesis-based |

---

## Question 4

**Explain the concept of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD).**

**Answer:**

KDD is the complete process of extracting useful, valid, and actionable knowledge from large databases. Data mining is the core step within KDD where actual pattern discovery occurs. KDD encompasses everything from raw data collection to final knowledge interpretation.

**KDD Process Steps:**

1. **Selection:** Choose relevant data from the database
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean data (handle missing values, noise, inconsistencies)
3. **Transformation:** Convert data into suitable format (normalization, aggregation)
4. **Data Mining:** Apply algorithms to discover patterns
5. **Interpretation/Evaluation:** Validate and interpret discovered patterns

**Visual Flow:**
```
Raw Data → Selection → Preprocessing → Transformation → Data Mining → Knowledge
```

**Core Concepts:**
- KDD is iterative—may loop back to earlier stages
- Data mining is one step in KDD, not the entire process
- Output: actionable knowledge, not just patterns

**Intuition:**
KDD is like refining crude oil: Selection (extract oil), Preprocessing (remove impurities), Transformation (distill), Data Mining (separate into products), Interpretation (quality check and use).

**Practical Relevance:**
- Provides structured methodology for real-world projects
- Ensures data quality before applying expensive algorithms
- Emphasizes business understanding and result validation

- **Link Analysis:** Discover relationships in graphs (e.g., social networks)

**Intuition:**
- Classification: "Is this email spam?" (yes/no answer)
- Clustering: "Group these customers by behavior" (no predefined labels)
- Association: "What products are bought together?" (relationships)

**Practical Relevance:**
- Task choice depends on problem type and data availability
- Classification/Regression need labeled data; Clustering/Association don't

**Answer:**

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores integrated, historical data from multiple sources in a structured format optimized for analysis and reporting. It serves as the primary data source for data mining, providing clean, consistent, and query-optimized data.

**Core Concepts:**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ETL** | Extract, Transform, Load - process to populate warehouse |
| **OLAP** | Online Analytical Processing - multidimensional analysis |
| **Schema** | Star/Snowflake schema for efficient querying |
| **Historical** | Stores time-variant data for trend analysis |

**Data Warehouse Characteristics:**
- **Subject-oriented:** Organized by business subjects (sales, customers)
- **Integrated:** Consistent format from multiple sources
- **Non-volatile:** Data is stable, not frequently updated
- **Time-variant:** Historical data for trend analysis

**Relevance to Data Mining:**
- Provides clean, preprocessed data ready for mining
- Enables historical pattern analysis
- OLAP cubes support multidimensional exploration
- Reduces preprocessing effort in mining projects

**Intuition:**
Data warehouse is like a well-organized library (clean, categorized, searchable). Data mining is the researcher who finds insights from the books. Without a good library, research becomes chaotic.

## Question 9

**What are the common data preprocessing techniques?**

**Answer:**

Data preprocessing transforms raw data into a clean, suitable format for mining. Key techniques include: Data Cleaning (handle missing/noisy data), Data Integration (combine multiple sources), Data Transformation (normalize, aggregate), Data Reduction (reduce dimensionality/volume), and Data Discretization (convert continuous to categorical).

**Preprocessing Techniques:**

| Technique | Purpose | Methods |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Data Cleaning** | Remove noise, fill missing values | Imputation, smoothing, outlier removal |
| **Data Integration** | Merge multiple data sources | Schema integration, entity resolution |
| **Data Transformation** | Convert to suitable format | Normalization, standardization, encoding |
| **Data Reduction** | Reduce data size | PCA, sampling, feature selection |
| **Data Discretization** | Bin continuous values | Equal-width, equal-frequency binning |

**Why Preprocessing Matters:**
- Real-world data is dirty: missing, inconsistent, noisy
- "Garbage in, garbage out" - poor data = poor models
- Preprocessing takes 60-80% of project time

**Common Operations:**
- Handle missing values: deletion, mean/median/mode imputation
- Handle outliers: Z-score, IQR method
- Encoding: One-hot, label encoding for categorical variables
- Scaling: Min-Max, Z-score normalization

**Practical Relevance:**
- Most algorithms assume clean, numeric data
- Proper preprocessing significantly improves model performance

---

## Question 10

**Explain the concept of data cleaning and why it is necessary.**

**Answer:**

Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant records from a dataset. It handles missing values, noise, inconsistencies, and duplicates. It's necessary because real-world data is inherently messy, and poor data quality directly degrades model performance.

**Data Quality Issues:**

| Issue | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Missing Values** | Empty or NULL entries | Imputation, deletion |
| **Noise** | Random errors in data | Smoothing, binning |
| **Inconsistency** | Conflicting data formats | Standardization |
| **Duplicates** | Repeated records | Deduplication |
| **Outliers** | Extreme abnormal values | Detection and handling |

**Data Cleaning Techniques:**

- **Missing Values:**
  - Delete rows/columns (if too many missing)
  - Impute with mean/median/mode
  - Use predictive models for imputation

- **Noise Handling:**
  - Binning: Sort and smooth by bin means
  - Regression: Fit data to functions
  - Clustering: Detect and remove outliers

- **Inconsistency:**
  - Use external references for validation
  - Apply business rules and constraints

**Why Necessary:**
- Models learn from data; noisy data = noisy predictions
- Inconsistent data breaks algorithms (e.g., "NY" vs "New York")
- Missing values cause algorithm failures or biased results

---

## Question 11

**How does data transformation differ from data normalization?**

**Answer:**

Data transformation is a broad term for any operation that changes data format or structure (encoding, aggregation, binning). Data normalization is a specific type of transformation that scales numeric features to a standard range (0-1 or mean=0, std=1) to ensure fair comparison across features.

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Data Transformation | Data Normalization |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Scope** | Broad - any format change | Specific - scaling numeric values |
| **Goal** | Make data suitable for mining | Bring features to same scale |
| **Examples** | Encoding, binning, aggregation | Min-Max, Z-score scaling |
| **Applies to** | All data types | Numeric features only |

**Data Transformation Types:**
- **Smoothing:** Remove noise (binning, regression)
- **Aggregation:** Summarize (daily → monthly sales)
- **Generalization:** Low-level → high-level (age → age-group)
- **Encoding:** Categorical → numeric (one-hot, label encoding)

**Data Normalization Formulas:**

- **Min-Max Normalization:** $x' = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$

- **Z-Score Standardization:** $x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$

**Why Normalization Matters:**
- Algorithms like KNN, SVM, Neural Networks are distance-based
- Without normalization, features with larger ranges dominate
- Example: Salary (10000-100000) vs Age (20-60) - salary would dominate distance calculations

## Question 12

**What are the techniques for data reduction in the context of data mining?**

**Answer:**

Data reduction techniques decrease data volume while preserving analytical integrity. Main approaches: Dimensionality Reduction (reduce features via PCA, feature selection), Numerosity Reduction (reduce data points via sampling, clustering), and Data Compression (encode data more compactly).

**Data Reduction Techniques:**

| Category | Technique | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Dimensionality Reduction** | PCA | Project to lower dimensions |
| | Feature Selection | Select subset of features |
| | LDA | Supervised dimensionality reduction |
| **Numerosity Reduction** | Sampling | Select representative subset |
| | Clustering | Replace data with cluster representatives |
| | Histograms | Store frequency distributions |
| **Data Compression** | Lossless | Exact reconstruction (ZIP) |
| | Lossy | Approximate reconstruction (JPEG) |

**Dimensionality Reduction Methods:**
- **Feature Selection:** Filter (correlation), Wrapper (RFE), Embedded (Lasso)
- **Feature Extraction:** PCA, t-SNE, Autoencoders

**Numerosity Reduction Methods:**
- **Parametric:** Fit model, store only parameters (regression)
- **Non-Parametric:** Histograms, clustering, sampling

**Why Data Reduction:**
- Reduces storage and computation costs
- Mitigates curse of dimensionality
- Improves model training time
- Can improve model performance by removing noise

**Practical Relevance:**
- Essential for Big Data scenarios
- PCA widely used before clustering/classification
- Sampling enables rapid prototyping

## Question 13

**What are the methods for outlier detection during data preprocessing?**

**Answer:**

Outlier detection identifies data points that deviate significantly from the majority. Key methods: Statistical (Z-score, IQR), Distance-based (KNN), Density-based (LOF, DBSCAN), and Clustering-based (points far from cluster centers). Choice depends on data distribution and dimensionality.

**Outlier Detection Methods:**

| Method | Approach | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Z-Score** | Points > 3 std from mean | Normally distributed data |
| **IQR** | Points outside Q1-1.5×IQR to Q3+1.5×IQR | Skewed distributions |
| **DBSCAN** | Points not in any dense region | Arbitrary-shaped clusters |
| **Isolation Forest** | Points easily isolated by random splits | High-dimensional data |
| **LOF** | Points with lower local density | Varying density data |

**Statistical Methods:**
- **Z-Score:** $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$, outlier if |z| > 3
- **IQR:** Outlier if x < Q1 - 1.5×IQR or x > Q3 + 1.5×IQR

**Algorithmic Methods:**
- **KNN Distance:** Points with high average distance to k neighbors
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF):** Compare local density to neighbors' density
- **Isolation Forest:** Anomalies are isolated quickly in random trees

**Handling Outliers:**
- Remove if clearly erroneous
- Cap/Floor (Winsorization) to threshold values
- Transform data (log transformation)
- Keep if meaningful (fraud cases are outliers but valuable)

**Interview Tip:**
Always ask: "Is this outlier noise or valuable information?" In fraud detection, outliers ARE the target.

## Question 14

**What are the different classifications of data mining algorithms?**

**Answer:**

Data mining algorithms are classified by: Learning Type (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement), Task Type (classification, regression, clustering, association), and Model Type (parametric vs non-parametric, linear vs non-linear, eager vs lazy learners).

**Classification by Learning Type:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Supervised** | Learns from labeled data | Decision Tree, SVM, Neural Networks |
| **Unsupervised** | Finds patterns without labels | K-Means, DBSCAN, Apriori |
| **Semi-Supervised** | Uses both labeled and unlabeled | Self-training, Label Propagation |
| **Reinforcement** | Learns from rewards/penalties | Q-Learning, Policy Gradient |

**Classification by Task:**
- **Classification:** Predict categorical labels (Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
- **Regression:** Predict continuous values (Linear Regression, SVR)
- **Clustering:** Group similar items (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- **Association:** Find item relationships (Apriori, FP-Growth)
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify outliers (Isolation Forest, LOF)

**Classification by Model Characteristics:**

| Aspect | Types |
|--------|-------|
| **Parametric vs Non-parametric** | Linear Regression vs KNN |
| **Eager vs Lazy** | Decision Tree vs KNN |
| **Generative vs Discriminative** | Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression |
| **Linear vs Non-linear** | Linear SVM vs RBF SVM |

**Practical Relevance:**
- Choose based on: data availability (labeled/unlabeled), task type, interpretability needs, computational resources

---

## Question 15

**Explain decision tree algorithms and their use in data mining.**

**Answer:**

Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms that recursively split data based on feature values to create a tree-like model for classification or regression. Each internal node represents a feature test, branches represent outcomes, and leaf nodes represent predictions. Popular for interpretability and handling mixed data types.

**Core Concepts:**
- **Root Node:** Starting point, contains all data
- **Internal Node:** Decision point based on feature condition
- **Leaf Node:** Final prediction (class label or value)
- **Splitting Criteria:** Metric to choose best feature split

**Splitting Criteria:**

| Metric | Formula | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Information Gain** | $IG = H(parent) - \sum \frac{n_i}{n} H(child_i)$ | ID3, C4.5 |
| **Gini Index** | $Gini = 1 - \sum p_i^2$ | CART |
| **Gain Ratio** | $GR = \frac{IG}{SplitInfo}$ | C4.5 |

**Algorithm Steps (ID3/CART):**
1. Calculate impurity of current node
2. For each feature, calculate impurity reduction if split
3. Select feature with maximum reduction
4. Split data and create child nodes
5. Repeat recursively until stopping criteria met

**Advantages:**
- Highly interpretable (white-box model)
- Handles both categorical and numerical data
- No feature scaling required
- Captures non-linear relationships

**Disadvantages:**
- Prone to overfitting
- Unstable (small data changes → different tree)
- Biased toward features with more levels

**Use in Data Mining:**
- Classification tasks, rule extraction, feature importance
- Base learners in Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

---

## Question 16

**What is the role of the Apriori algorithm in data mining?**

**Answer:**

Apriori is a foundational algorithm for Association Rule Mining that discovers frequent itemsets and generates association rules from transactional databases. It uses the "apriori principle" (all subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent) to efficiently prune the search space.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Itemset:** Collection of items (e.g., {bread, milk})
- **Support:** Frequency of itemset in transactions
- **Confidence:** How often rule is correct
- **Lift:** Strength of rule over random co-occurrence

**Metrics:**

$$Support(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{count(A \cup B)}{N}$$

$$Confidence(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{Support(A \cup B)}{Support(A)}$$

$$Lift(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{Confidence(A \rightarrow B)}{Support(B)}$$

**Apriori Algorithm Steps:**
1. Set minimum support threshold
2. Generate candidate 1-itemsets, prune by support
3. Generate k-itemsets from (k-1)-itemsets
4. Prune candidates whose subsets are infrequent (Apriori principle)
5. Count support, keep frequent itemsets
6. Repeat until no new frequent itemsets
7. Generate rules from frequent itemsets, filter by confidence

**Example:**
- Transaction data: {bread, milk}, {bread, butter}, {bread, milk, butter}
- Rule: {bread} → {milk}, Support=66%, Confidence=66%

**Limitations:**
- Multiple database scans
- Generates many candidates
- Alternative: FP-Growth (faster, no candidate generation)

**Use Cases:** Market basket analysis, recommendation systems, cross-selling

## Question 17

**How does k-means clustering work in the context of data mining?**

**Answer:**

K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions n data points into k clusters by iteratively assigning points to nearest centroids and updating centroids until convergence. It minimizes within-cluster sum of squared distances (inertia).

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Choose k (number of clusters)
2. Initialize k centroids randomly
3. **Assignment:** Assign each point to nearest centroid
4. **Update:** Recalculate centroids as mean of assigned points
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until centroids don't change (convergence)

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Objective: Minimize within-cluster variance (inertia)

$$J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2$$

Where $\mu_i$ is centroid of cluster $C_i$

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Complexity:** O(n × k × iterations × dimensions)
- **Distance Metric:** Euclidean (default)
- **Convergence:** Guaranteed but may be local minimum

**Choosing k:**
- **Elbow Method:** Plot inertia vs k, find "elbow" point
- **Silhouette Score:** Measures cluster separation
- **Domain Knowledge:** Business requirements

**Advantages:**
- Simple, fast, scalable
- Works well with spherical clusters

**Limitations:**
- Must specify k in advance
- Sensitive to initialization (use K-Means++)
- Assumes spherical, equal-sized clusters
- Sensitive to outliers

**Use in Data Mining:**
- Customer segmentation, image compression, document clustering, anomaly detection

---

## Question 18

**Describe the concept of Association Rule Mining.**

**Answer:**

Association Rule Mining discovers interesting relationships (rules) between variables in large databases. It finds patterns like "if X then Y" from transactional data, measured by support (frequency), confidence (reliability), and lift (strength over random).

**Core Concepts:**
- **Rule Format:** X → Y (if X, then Y)
- **Antecedent (X):** Left-hand side (condition)
- **Consequent (Y):** Right-hand side (result)
- **Frequent Itemset:** Itemset meeting minimum support

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Support** | P(X ∩ Y) | How often rule appears |
| **Confidence** | P(Y\|X) = P(X∩Y)/P(X) | Rule reliability |
| **Lift** | P(X∩Y) / (P(X)×P(Y)) | >1: positive correlation |

**Process:**
1. Find all frequent itemsets (support ≥ min_support)
2. Generate rules from frequent itemsets
3. Filter rules by confidence ≥ min_confidence
4. Rank by lift for actionable insights

**Algorithms:**
- **Apriori:** Level-wise candidate generation
- **FP-Growth:** Frequent pattern tree, no candidate generation
- **Eclat:** Vertical data format, set intersection

**Example:**
- Data: Retail transactions
- Rule: {Bread, Butter} → {Milk}
- Interpretation: Customers buying bread and butter often buy milk

**Applications:**
- Market basket analysis, cross-selling
- Web usage mining, recommendation systems
- Medical diagnosis patterns

## Question 19

**What is the Naive Bayes classifier and how is it used in data mining?**

**Answer:**

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption that features are conditionally independent given the class. Despite this simplification, it performs surprisingly well for text classification, spam detection, and high-dimensional data.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

$$P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(X)}$$

**Naive Assumption:**

$$P(X|C) = P(x_1|C) \cdot P(x_2|C) \cdot ... \cdot P(x_n|C) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)$$

**Classification Rule:**

$$\hat{y} = \arg\max_C P(C) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)$$

**Variants:**

| Type | Feature Distribution | Use Case |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| **Gaussian NB** | Continuous (normal) | General numeric data |
| **Multinomial NB** | Discrete (counts) | Text classification |
| **Bernoulli NB** | Binary (0/1) | Binary features |

**Advantages:**
- Fast training and prediction
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Good baseline for text classification

**Limitations:**
- Assumes feature independence (rarely true)
- Sensitive to feature correlation
- Zero probability problem (solved by Laplace smoothing)

**Use in Data Mining:**
- Spam filtering, sentiment analysis
- Document classification
- Real-time prediction systems (fast inference)

## Question 20

**Explain the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in the context of data mining.**

**Answer:**

SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes by maximizing the margin between classes. It uses kernel functions to handle non-linear data by mapping to higher dimensions. Effective for high-dimensional spaces and text classification.

**Core Concepts:**
- **Hyperplane:** Decision boundary separating classes
- **Margin:** Distance between hyperplane and nearest points
- **Support Vectors:** Data points closest to hyperplane
- **Kernel Trick:** Implicit mapping to higher dimensions

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Linear SVM: Find $w, b$ that maximizes margin

$$\min \frac{1}{2}||w||^2$$
subject to: $y_i(w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1$

**Kernel Functions:**

| Kernel | Formula | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Linear** | $K(x,y) = x \cdot y$ | Linearly separable |
| **Polynomial** | $K(x,y) = (x \cdot y + c)^d$ | Feature interactions |
| **RBF/Gaussian** | $K(x,y) = e^{-\gamma||x-y||^2}$ | Non-linear, most common |

**Soft Margin SVM:**
- Allows misclassification with penalty C
- High C: Low bias, high variance (strict margin)
- Low C: High bias, low variance (soft margin)

**Advantages:**
- Effective in high dimensions
- Memory efficient (uses support vectors only)
- Versatile with different kernels

**Limitations:**
- Slow on large datasets (O(n²) to O(n³))
- Sensitive to feature scaling
- Not directly probabilistic

**Use in Data Mining:** Text classification, image recognition, bioinformatics

## Question 21

**Explain cross-validation as it applies to data mining.**

**Answer:**

Cross-validation is a model evaluation technique that partitions data into multiple subsets, training on some and validating on others, rotating through all subsets. It provides a more reliable estimate of model performance than a single train-test split and helps detect overfitting.

**K-Fold Cross-Validation Process:**
1. Split data into k equal folds
2. For each fold i (1 to k):
   - Train on k-1 folds
   - Validate on fold i
3. Average performance across all k folds

**Types of Cross-Validation:**

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **K-Fold** | k equal partitions | General use (k=5 or 10) |
| **Stratified K-Fold** | Preserves class distribution | Imbalanced datasets |
| **Leave-One-Out (LOO)** | k = n (each point is test) | Small datasets |
| **Time-Series Split** | Respects temporal order | Sequential data |
| **Holdout** | Single train-test split | Large datasets, quick check |

**Why Cross-Validation:**
- More robust than single split
- Uses all data for both training and validation
- Better estimate of generalization error
- Reduces variance in performance estimate

**Formula (K-Fold):**

$$CV_{score} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} Score_i$$

**Common Values:**
- k = 5 or k = 10 (good bias-variance tradeoff)
- k = n (LOO): Low bias, high variance, computationally expensive

**Interview Tip:**
Never use cross-validation for time-series data without temporal ordering—future data leaking into training causes overly optimistic estimates.

## Question 22

**What are the challenges of big data mining?**

**Answer:**

Big Data mining faces challenges across the "5 Vs": Volume (scale), Velocity (speed), Variety (types), Veracity (quality), and Value (extracting insights). Technical challenges include distributed processing, scalability, real-time analysis, and maintaining model quality with noisy heterogeneous data.

**The 5 V Challenges:**

| V | Challenge | Impact |
|---|-----------|--------|
| **Volume** | Massive scale (TB/PB) | Storage, memory, computation |
| **Velocity** | Real-time/streaming data | Processing speed, latency |
| **Variety** | Structured + unstructured | Integration, preprocessing |
| **Veracity** | Noisy, incomplete data | Data quality, trust |
| **Value** | Extracting actionable insights | ROI justification |

**Technical Challenges:**

## Question 23

**Describe the importance of feature selection and feature engineering in data mining.**

**Answer:**

Feature selection chooses the most relevant features from existing ones, reducing dimensionality and overfitting. Feature engineering creates new features from raw data to better represent the underlying problem. Both significantly impact model performance—often more than algorithm choice.

**Feature Selection:**

| Method | Approach | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Filter** | Rank by statistical metrics | Correlation, Chi-square, Mutual Information |
| **Wrapper** | Evaluate feature subsets | RFE, Forward/Backward Selection |
| **Embedded** | Selection during training | Lasso (L1), Tree-based importance |

**Feature Engineering:**

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Transformation** | Mathematical changes | Log, sqrt, Box-Cox |
| **Binning** | Discretize continuous | Age → age_group |
| **Interaction** | Combine features | price × quantity = revenue |
| **Aggregation** | Summarize groups | Mean, count per user |
| **Time-based** | Extract temporal info | Day of week, hour, is_weekend |
| **Domain-specific** | Business knowledge | BMI from height & weight |

**Why Important:**

- **Curse of Dimensionality:** More features → sparse data, overfitting
- **Noise Reduction:** Remove irrelevant features
- **Interpretability:** Fewer features, clearer model
- **Computation:** Faster training with fewer features
- **Better Representations:** Good features capture the problem better

**Interview Tip:**
"A machine learning model is only as good as the features you give it." Feature engineering is often where domain expertise creates competitive advantage.
