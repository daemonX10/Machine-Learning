# Data Mining Interview Questions - General Questions

## Question 1

**Why is data preprocessing an important step in data mining?**

**Answer:**

Data preprocessing is crucial because real-world data is inherently dirty—containing missing values, noise, inconsistencies, and outliers. Quality preprocessing directly impacts model performance ("garbage in, garbage out"), reduces training time, improves algorithm convergence, and ensures meaningful pattern discovery.

**Key Reasons:**

| Issue | Impact Without Preprocessing | Solution |
|-------|----------------------------|----------|
| **Missing Values** | Algorithm failure, biased results | Imputation, deletion |
| **Noise** | Poor model generalization | Smoothing, outlier removal |
| **Inconsistency** | Conflicting patterns | Standardization |
| **Different Scales** | Feature dominance in distance-based algorithms | Normalization |
| **High Dimensionality** | Curse of dimensionality, overfitting | Feature selection, PCA |

**Preprocessing Impact:**
- **Model Performance:** Clean data → accurate patterns
- **Training Efficiency:** Reduced data → faster training
- **Algorithm Requirements:** Many algorithms require numeric, scaled data
- **Interpretability:** Consistent data → meaningful insights

**Typical Preprocessing Pipeline:**
1. Handle missing values
2. Remove duplicates
3. Handle outliers
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Scale/normalize features
6. Feature selection/engineering

**Practical Relevance:**
Data scientists spend 60-80% of project time on preprocessing—it's not glamorous but determines success.

## Question 2

**How do you handle missing values in a dataset?**

**Answer:**

Handling missing values depends on the amount, pattern, and mechanism of missingness. Main approaches: Deletion (remove rows/columns), Imputation (fill with statistics or predictions), and Indicator methods (flag missing as a feature). Choice depends on data size and whether missingness is random.

**Missing Data Mechanisms:**
- **MCAR (Missing Completely at Random):** No pattern, safe to delete
- **MAR (Missing at Random):** Depends on observed data
- **MNAR (Missing Not at Random):** Depends on unobserved data (problematic)

**Handling Strategies:**

| Method | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **Listwise Deletion** | Small % missing, MCAR | Simple | Loses data |
| **Mean/Median/Mode** | Quick fix, few missing | Fast | Reduces variance |
| **Forward/Backward Fill** | Time series | Preserves temporal | May propagate errors |
| **KNN Imputation** | Similar records exist | Uses relationships | Computationally expensive |
| **Model-based (MICE)** | Complex patterns | Accurate | Complex implementation |
| **Missing Indicator** | Missingness is informative | Preserves signal | Adds features |

**Decision Framework:**
1. Check % missing: >50% column → consider dropping
2. Check pattern: MCAR/MAR → impute; MNAR → investigate
3. Check data type: Numeric → mean/median; Categorical → mode
4. Check model sensitivity: Tree-based handles missing natively

**Code Approach:**
```python
# Simple imputation
df['col'].fillna(df['col'].median(), inplace=True)

# KNN imputation
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
df_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(df)
```

## Question 4

**What considerations should be made when choosing a data mining algorithm?**

**Answer:**

Algorithm selection depends on: problem type (classification/clustering/etc.), data characteristics (size, dimensionality, types), interpretability requirements, computational resources, accuracy needs, and deployment constraints. No single algorithm is best for all problems—consider multiple factors.

**Key Considerations:**

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|-----------------|

| **Accuracy** | (TP+TN) / Total | Balanced classes |
| **Precision** | TP / (TP+FP) | False positives costly |
| **Recall** | TP / (TP+FN) | False negatives costly |
| **F1 Score** | 2×(P×R)/(P+R) | Balance precision/recall |
| **AUC-ROC** | Area under ROC curve | Overall ranking ability |

**Regression Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **MSE** | $\frac{1}{n}\sum(y-\hat{y})^2$ | Penalizes large errors |
| **RMSE** | $\sqrt{MSE}$ | Same unit as target |
| **MAE** | $\frac{1}{n}\sum|y-\hat{y}|$ | Robust to outliers |
| **R²** | $1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$ | Variance explained |

**Clustering Metrics:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Silhouette Score** | Cohesion vs separation (-1 to 1) |
| **Inertia** | Within-cluster sum of squares |
| **Davies-Bouldin** | Average similarity between clusters |

**Evaluation Best Practices:**
- Use train-test split or cross-validation
- Stratify for imbalanced data
- Consider business impact, not just metrics
- Use confusion matrix for detailed analysis

## Question 8

**How do recommendation systems use data mining to provide personalized suggestions?**

**Answer:**

Recommendation systems use data mining techniques to analyze user behavior and preferences. Main approaches: Collaborative Filtering (user-user or item-item similarity), Content-Based (item features matching user preferences), and Hybrid methods combining both. They mine purchase history, ratings, and browsing patterns.

**Recommendation Approaches:**

| Method | Data Used | Technique | Example |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Collaborative Filtering** | User-item interactions | Similarity, matrix factorization | "Users like you also bought..." |
| **Content-Based** | Item features | Feature matching | "Because you watched action movies..." |
| **Hybrid** | Both | Combined models | Netflix, Amazon |
| **Association Rules** | Transaction data | Apriori, FP-Growth | "Frequently bought together" |

**Collaborative Filtering Types:**

- **User-Based:** Find similar users, recommend their items
  - Similarity: Cosine, Pearson correlation
  
- **Item-Based:** Find similar items to what user liked
  - More scalable than user-based

- **Matrix Factorization:** Decompose user-item matrix
  - SVD, ALS for latent factors

**Content-Based Approach:**
1. Build item profiles (features)
2. Build user profiles (preferences)
3. Match user profile to item profiles
4. Recommend highest matches

**Challenges:**
- **Cold Start:** New users/items with no history
- **Sparsity:** Most users rate few items
