# Probability Interview Questions - Scenario_Based Questions

## Question 1

**How would you use probability to design a recommendation system model?**

---

### 1. Scenario Understanding
- User-item rating matrix R with many missing entries
- Goal: Predict missing ratings to recommend items

### 2. Approach: Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)

| Component | Probabilistic Model |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Rating** | $R_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(U_i^T V_j, \sigma^2)$ |
| **User Prior** | $U_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_U^2 I)$ |
| **Item Prior** | $V_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_V^2 I)$ |

- $U_i$: Latent user preference vector
- $V_j$: Latent item feature vector
- Priors act as regularization

### 3. Algorithm Steps (Byheart)
```
1. Initialize U, V randomly
2. Optimize (SGD or ALS):
   - Maximize likelihood of observed ratings
   - Regularize via Gaussian priors
3. Predict: rating_ij = dot(U_i, V_j)
4. Recommend: Sort items by predicted rating
```

### 4. Why Probabilistic?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sparsity** | Priors help with few observations |
| **Uncertainty** | Can estimate confidence in predictions |
| **Cold Start** | New users/items start at prior mean |
| **Regularization** | Built-in via Gaussian priors |

### 5. Interview Tip
Mention extensions: Bayesian PMF (full posterior), Neural Collaborative Filtering (combines with deep learning)

## Question 2

**Propose a method for predicting customer churn using probabilistic models.**

---

### 1. Scenario Understanding
- Predict P(Churn = 1 | Customer Features)
- Need actionable probability score
- Must balance precision vs recall

### 2. Recommended Approach: Logistic Regression

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Outputs calibrated probability P(churn)
- Interpretable coefficients (odds ratios)
- Simple, fast, reliable baseline

### 3. Feature Engineering

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Usage** | Login frequency, session duration |
| **Support** | Ticket count, resolution time |
| **Billing** | Plan type, payment failures |
| **Tenure** | Account age, engagement trend |

### 4. Model Output
$$P(\text{churn}) = \sigma(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n)$$

Score: 0 to 1 (e.g., 0.85 = 85% churn risk)

### 5. Decision Logic
```python
# Cost analysis: C_FN >> C_FP → lower threshold
threshold = 0.3  # More conservative: catch more churners

high_risk = customers[churn_prob > threshold]
# Trigger intervention: discount, outreach, etc.
```

### 6. Advanced Alternative: Survival Analysis
- Cox Proportional Hazards model
- Outputs: S(t) = P(customer survives to time t)
- Handles censoring (customers who haven't churned yet)

### 7. Interview Tip
Emphasize: threshold depends on business costs (intervention cost vs customer lifetime value)

## Question 3

**Discuss how you would use probabilities to detect anomalies in transaction data.**

---

### 1. Scenario Understanding
- Goal: Flag unusual transactions as potential fraud
- Challenge: Anomalies are rare, normal behavior varies

### 2. Approach: Density-Based Anomaly Detection

**Core Idea**: Model "normal" → flag low-probability events

### 3. Feature Selection

| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Transaction amount | Unusual amounts |
| Time of day | Odd hours |
| Frequency | Burst activity |
| Location deviation | Geographic anomaly |
| Merchant category | Unusual spending pattern |

### 4. Model Normal Behavior

**Option A: Multivariate Gaussian**
$$p(x) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)\right)$$

**Option B: Gaussian Mixture Model**
For multi-modal patterns (weekday vs weekend)

### 5. Algorithm Steps
```
1. Fit μ, Σ on NORMAL transactions only
2. For new transaction x:
   - Compute p(x) using fitted model
3. If p(x) < threshold → ANOMALY
4. Threshold = 1st percentile of training densities
```

### 6. Code (Writable)
```python
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal
import numpy as np

# Fit on normal transactions
mu = np.mean(normal_transactions, axis=0)
sigma = np.cov(normal_transactions.T)

# Score new transactions
scores = multivariate_normal.pdf(new_transactions, mean=mu, cov=sigma)

# Flag bottom 1%
threshold = np.percentile(scores, 1)
anomalies = new_transactions[scores < threshold]
```

### 7. Interview Tips
- Log-transform skewed features (amounts)
- Retrain periodically (concept drift)
- Alternative: Autoencoders (high reconstruction error = anomaly)

## Question 4

**Describe how you might use Bayesian methods to improve the performance of a spam classifier.**

---

### 1. Definition
Standard Naive Bayes uses point estimates (MLE). Bayesian methods add priors and output probability distributions over parameters, improving robustness especially for rare words and small datasets.

### 2. Core Improvements

| Problem | Bayesian Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Zero probability** for unseen words | Laplace smoothing = uniform prior |
| **Overfitting** to training words | Prior belief that most words are neutral |
| **Overconfidence** in predictions | Output full posterior distribution |
| **Cold start** (new words) | Prior provides reasonable defaults |

### 3. Algorithm: Bayesian Spam Classifier
```
1. Set prior: Beta(α, β) for each word's spam probability
2. For each word w in vocabulary:
   a. Count occurrences in spam/ham
   b. Posterior: Beta(α + spam_count, β + ham_count)
3. For new email:
   a. Compute P(word|spam) from posterior mean
   b. Apply Naive Bayes rule with uncertainty
4. Flag low-confidence predictions for human review
```

### 4. Key Insight: Laplace Smoothing IS Bayesian
```python
# Standard MLE (fails for unseen words)
p_word_spam = count_word_in_spam / total_spam_words

# Bayesian with uniform prior (Laplace smoothing)
alpha, beta = 1, 1  # Beta(1,1) = Uniform prior
p_word_spam = (count_word_in_spam + alpha) / (total_spam_words + alpha + beta)
```

### 5. Hierarchical Bayesian Model
- Different spam types (pharma, financial) share strength
- Rare word in pharma spam → borrow info from other spam types
- Better generalization with limited data

### 6. Practical Benefits
- **Calibrated probabilities**: 70% confidence means 70% accuracy
- **Uncertainty awareness**: Flag borderline cases (51% vs 99%)
- **Handles rare events**: New words don't break the model

### 7. Interview Tip
Mention: Laplace smoothing is equivalent to adding Beta(1,1) prior — connects classical NLP technique to Bayesian framework.

## Question 5

**Explain a situation where you would use Markov Chains for modeling customer behavior on a website.**

---

### 1. Definition
A Markov Chain models user navigation where the next page depends only on the current page. States = pages, transitions = clicks. Enables funnel analysis, conversion prediction, and UX optimization.

### 2. Scenario
E-commerce company wants to understand user navigation patterns and optimize conversion funnel.

### 3. Model Setup
| Component | Representation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **States** | Pages: Homepage, Category, Product, Cart, Checkout |
| **Special States** | (Start), (Conversion), (Exit) |
| **Transitions** | P[i,j] = P(go to page j \| on page i) |
| **Data Source** | Clickstream logs |

### 4. Algorithm: Build Transition Matrix
```
1. Parse clickstream data into sessions
2. For each session: record (page_i → page_j) transitions
3. Count all transition pairs
4. Normalize: P[i,j] = count(i→j) / total(i→*)
5. Analyze matrix for insights
```

### 5. Python Example
```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

# Build transition matrix from sessions
transition_counts = defaultdict(Counter)
for session in sessions:
    for i in range(len(session) - 1):
        transition_counts[session[i]][session[i+1]] += 1

# Convert to probabilities
transition_probs = {}
for page, counts in transition_counts.items():
    total = sum(counts.values())
    transition_probs[page] = {next_page: c/total for next_page, c in counts.items()}

# Example: P(Exit | Cart) = 0.60 → Cart page has issues!
```

### 6. Business Applications
| Use Case | Insight |
|----------|---------|
| **Funnel Analysis** | High P(Exit \| Cart) = cart abandonment issue |
| **Conversion Probability** | P(eventually convert \| current page) |
| **Page Value** | Which pages lead to conversions? |
| **A/B Testing** | How do changes affect transition matrix? |

### 7. Interview Tip
Markov assumption (next page depends only on current) is a simplification — works well in practice. Mention you could extend to 2nd-order Markov if needed.
