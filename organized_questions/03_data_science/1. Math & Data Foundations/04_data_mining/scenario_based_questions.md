## Question 2

**Explain how you might use data mining to detect anomalies in network traffic for cybersecurity.**

**Answer:**

Network anomaly detection uses data mining to identify unusual traffic patterns indicating cyber threats (DDoS attacks, intrusion attempts, malware). Techniques include unsupervised methods (clustering, autoencoders) to find deviations from normal behavior and supervised classification trained on known attack signatures.

**Approach:**

**1. Data Collection:**
- Network flow data (NetFlow, pcap)
- Features: packet counts, bytes, ports, protocols, duration
- Connection metadata, flags, timing

**2. Feature Engineering:**
- Aggregate statistics per connection/time window
- Ratio features (bytes in/out ratio)
- Temporal patterns (requests per second)
- Behavioral features (unique ports accessed)

**3. Mining Techniques:**

| Technique | Approach | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Clustering** | Group normal traffic, flag outliers | Unknown attack detection |
| **Isolation Forest** | Isolate anomalies quickly | High-dimensional data |
| **Autoencoders** | Learn normal patterns, high reconstruction error = anomaly | Complex patterns |
| **Supervised Classification** | Train on labeled attacks | Known attack types |
| **Time-Series Analysis** | Detect temporal anomalies | DDoS, scanning |

**4. Detection Pipeline:**
1. Baseline normal behavior during training
2. Real-time scoring of incoming traffic
3. Flag high anomaly scores for investigation
4. Feedback loop to reduce false positives

**Challenges:**
- High volume, velocity data (streaming)
- Class imbalance (attacks are rare)
- Evolving attack patterns (concept drift)
- Low false positive tolerance

**Practical Relevance:**
Data mining enables proactive threat detection beyond signature-based systems.

| **Cart Page** | Frequently bought together | Association rules (Apriori) |
| **Search Results** | Personalized ranking | Learning to rank |
| **Email** | Re-engagement | Purchase prediction |

**3. Implementation Approach**

**Collaborative Filtering:**
- Build user-item interaction matrix
- Apply matrix factorization (ALS) for latent factors
- Recommend items from similar users

**Content-Based:**
- Extract product features (category, brand, price range)
- Use embeddings for text/image similarity
- Match user preference profile to items

**Association Rules:**
- Mine transaction data with Apriori/FP-Growth
- Identify high-lift associations
- Display "Customers also bought"

**4. Evaluation & Optimization**
- Offline: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG
- Online: A/B test CTR, conversion, revenue
- Address cold start with popularity fallback

**Key Insight:**
Best systems combine multiple approaches—hybrid recommendations outperform single methods.
