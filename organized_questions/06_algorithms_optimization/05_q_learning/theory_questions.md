# Q Learning Interview Questions - Theory Questions

## Question 1

**What is Q-learning, and how does it fit in the field of reinforcement learning?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Q-learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function (Q-function) to find the best action to take in each state. It learns from experience without requiring a model of the environment.

**Position in RL:**

```
Reinforcement Learning
├── Model-Based (learns environment model)
│   └── Planning-based methods
└── Model-Free (learns from experience directly)
    ├── Value-Based Methods
    │   ├── Q-Learning ← Off-policy
    │   └── SARSA ← On-policy
    └── Policy-Based Methods
        └── Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Model-free**: Doesn't need transition probabilities P(s'|s,a)
- **Off-policy**: Can learn optimal policy while following exploratory policy
- **Value-based**: Learns Q-values, derives policy from them
- **Temporal Difference**: Updates estimates based on other estimates

**Q-Learning Update Rule:**
$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$$

**Intuition:**
Agent interacts with environment, receives rewards, and updates its Q-table to eventually know the expected return of each state-action pair.

---

## Question 2

**Can you describe the concept of the Q-table in Q-learning?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
A Q-table is a lookup table that stores Q-values for all state-action pairs. Rows represent states, columns represent actions, and cells contain expected cumulative rewards.

**Structure:**
```
             Action 1    Action 2    Action 3
State 1        0.5         0.8         0.3
State 2        0.2         0.6         0.9
State 3        0.7         0.4         0.5
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Size**: |States| × |Actions| entries
- **Initialization**: Usually zeros or small random values
- **Updates**: Modified during training via Q-learning update rule

**How Q-table Works:**
1. **Lookup**: Given current state, find row in table
2. **Action Selection**: Choose action with highest Q-value (or explore)
3. **Update**: After taking action, update cell using:
   $$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$$

**Limitations:**
- Only works for discrete, finite state/action spaces
- Memory grows exponentially with state dimensions
- Cannot generalize to unseen states

**When Q-table Works:**
- Small, discrete environments (gridworld, simple games)
- When all states can be enumerated

**Alternative for Large Spaces:**
Function approximation (neural networks) → Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

---

## Question 3

**How does Q-learning differ from other types of reinforcement learning such as policy gradient methods?**

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Q-Learning | Policy Gradient |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **What it learns** | Value function Q(s,a) | Policy π(a|s) directly |
| **Policy derivation** | Implicit: argmax Q(s,a) | Explicit: parameterized policy |
| **Action space** | Discrete (typically) | Continuous or discrete |
| **Optimization** | TD updates | Gradient ascent on expected return |
| **Sample efficiency** | More efficient | Less efficient (high variance) |
| **Off-policy** | Yes | Usually on-policy |

**Key Differences:**

**1. Learning Target:**
- Q-learning: Learns Q(s,a) → derives policy as π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)
- Policy Gradient: Directly learns π_θ(a|s)

**2. Update Mechanism:**
- Q-learning: $Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$
- Policy Gradient: $\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) \cdot G_t$

**3. Exploration:**
- Q-learning: Epsilon-greedy (random exploration)
- Policy Gradient: Stochastic policy naturally explores

**4. Continuous Actions:**
- Q-learning: Struggles (needs discretization or actor-critic)
- Policy Gradient: Naturally handles continuous actions

**When to Use:**
- **Q-learning**: Discrete actions, need sample efficiency
- **Policy Gradient**: Continuous actions, complex policies

---

## Question 4

**Explain what is meant by the term 'action-value function' in the context of Q-learning.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
The action-value function Q(s,a) represents the expected cumulative reward an agent will receive by taking action a in state s and then following the optimal policy thereafter.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
$$Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}\left[R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + ... | S_t=s, A_t=a\right]$$

Or recursively (Bellman equation):
$$Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}\left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a')\right]$$

**Comparison with State-Value Function:**

| Function | Symbol | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| State-value | V(s) | Expected return starting from state s |
| Action-value | Q(s,a) | Expected return taking action a in state s |

**Relationship:**
$$V(s) = \max_a Q(s,a)$$

**Why Q-function is Useful:**
- Directly provides policy: π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)
- No need for environment model to select actions
- Enables off-policy learning

**Intuition:**
Think of Q(s,a) as answering: "If I'm in situation s and do action a, how much total reward can I expect?"

**Example (Gridworld):**
- State: Current cell position
- Action: Move up/down/left/right
- Q(cell_5, move_right) = 0.8 means moving right from cell 5 yields expected return of 0.8

---

## Question 5

**Describe the role of the learning rate (α) and discount factor (γ) in the Q-learning algorithm.**

**Answer:**

**Q-Learning Update Rule:**
$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$$

---

**Learning Rate (α) - Range: 0 to 1**

| α Value | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **High (0.9)** | Fast learning, may oscillate, forget old experiences |
| **Low (0.1)** | Slow, stable learning, retains past knowledge |
| **0** | No learning (Q-values never change) |
| **1** | Complete replacement (only newest experience matters) |

**Role:**
- Controls how much new information overrides old Q-values
- Balances stability vs. adaptability
- Often decayed over time: α_t = α_0 / (1 + t)

---

**Discount Factor (γ) - Range: 0 to 1**

| γ Value | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **High (0.99)** | Values future rewards highly, long-term planning |
| **Low (0.1)** | Prioritizes immediate rewards, myopic behavior |
| **0** | Only cares about immediate reward |
| **1** | Future rewards equal to current (risky for infinite horizons) |

**Role:**
- Determines importance of future vs. immediate rewards
- Mathematically: future reward at step k is weighted by γ^k
- Ensures convergence in infinite-horizon problems

---

**Intuition:**
- α = "How quickly should I update my beliefs?"
- γ = "How much do I care about the future?"

**Common Values:**
- α: 0.1 to 0.5 (often decayed)
- γ: 0.9 to 0.99

---

## Question 6

**What is the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Q-learning, and how is it typically handled?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
The exploration-exploitation trade-off is the dilemma between:
- **Exploitation**: Choosing the best known action (highest Q-value)
- **Exploration**: Trying new actions to discover potentially better options

**The Problem:**
- Pure exploitation: May miss better actions, stuck in local optima
- Pure exploration: Never uses learned knowledge, poor performance

---

**Common Solutions:**

**1. Epsilon-Greedy (Most Common)**
```
With probability ε: random action
With probability 1-ε: argmax Q(s,a)
```
- Start with high ε (e.g., 1.0), decay over time
- Simple and effective

**2. Epsilon Decay Strategies:**
- Linear: ε_t = max(ε_min, ε_0 - decay_rate × t)
- Exponential: ε_t = max(ε_min, ε_0 × decay^t)

**3. Boltzmann (Softmax) Exploration:**
$$P(a|s) = \frac{e^{Q(s,a)/\tau}}{\sum_{a'} e^{Q(s,a')/\tau}}$$
- τ (temperature): High = more exploration, Low = more exploitation
- Actions selected proportional to their Q-values

**4. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):**
$$a = \arg\max_a \left[Q(s,a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{N(s,a)}}\right]$$
- Explores less-visited actions
- Balances uncertainty in Q-estimates

---

**Best Practice:**
Start with high exploration, gradually shift to exploitation as agent learns.

---

## Question 7

**Describe the process of updating the Q-values in Q-learning.**

**Answer:**

**Q-Learning Update Rule:**
$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$$

**Components:**
- **Q(s,a)**: Current estimate of action-value
- **α**: Learning rate
- **r**: Immediate reward received
- **γ**: Discount factor
- **max Q(s',a')**: Best Q-value in next state (target)
- **TD Error**: $[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$

---

**Step-by-Step Process:**

```
1. Observe current state s
2. Select action a (using ε-greedy or other policy)
3. Execute action a, observe reward r and next state s'
4. Calculate TD target: target = r + γ × max_a' Q(s', a')
5. Calculate TD error: error = target - Q(s, a)
6. Update Q-value: Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α × error
7. Move to state s': s = s'
8. Repeat until episode ends
```

---

**Example:**
```
Current: Q(s=3, a=right) = 0.5
Reward received: r = 1
Next state: s' = 4
Best Q-value in s': max Q(4, a) = 0.8
α = 0.1, γ = 0.9

Target = 1 + 0.9 × 0.8 = 1.72
TD Error = 1.72 - 0.5 = 1.22
New Q(3, right) = 0.5 + 0.1 × 1.22 = 0.622
```

**Key Insight:**
Q-values are updated toward the **target** (immediate reward + discounted future value), moving gradually based on learning rate.

---

## Question 8

**What is the Bellman Equation, and how does it relate to Q-learning?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
The Bellman Equation is a recursive equation that expresses the value of a state (or state-action pair) in terms of immediate reward plus discounted future values.

**Bellman Equation for Q-function:**
$$Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}\left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a') | s, a\right]$$

**Expanded Form:**
$$Q^*(s,a) = \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) \left[R(s,a,s') + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a')\right]$$

---

**Relationship to Q-Learning:**

Q-learning is a **sampling-based approximation** of the Bellman equation:

| Bellman Equation | Q-Learning |
|------------------|------------|
| Requires P(s'|s,a) | Model-free (samples transitions) |
| Exact solution | Iterative approximation |
| Expectation over all s' | Single sample s' |

**Q-Learning Update (Bellman Backup):**
$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \underbrace{[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]}_{\text{TD error toward Bellman target}}$$

---

**Intuition:**
- Bellman equation defines what optimal Q-values should satisfy
- Q-learning iteratively adjusts Q-values toward satisfying this equation
- At convergence: Q-values satisfy Bellman optimality equation

**Types of Bellman Equations:**
1. **Bellman Expectation**: For a given policy π
2. **Bellman Optimality**: For optimal policy (used in Q-learning)

---

## Question 9

**Explain the importance of convergence in Q-learning. How is it achieved?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Convergence in Q-learning means the Q-values stabilize and approach the true optimal values Q*(s,a) as training progresses.

**Why Convergence Matters:**
- Ensures learned policy is optimal (or near-optimal)
- Guarantees consistent behavior after training
- Validates that learning process is working correctly

---

**Conditions for Convergence (Theoretical Guarantees):**

1. **All state-action pairs visited infinitely often**
   - Every (s,a) must be explored enough times
   - Requires sufficient exploration

2. **Learning rate satisfies Robbins-Monro conditions:**
   $$\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \alpha_t = \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \alpha_t^2 < \infty$$
   - Example: α_t = 1/(1+t) satisfies this

3. **Markov property holds** (MDP assumption)

4. **Bounded rewards**

---

**Practical Convergence Strategies:**

| Strategy | How It Helps |
|----------|--------------|
| Decaying ε | Ensures exploration early, exploitation later |
| Decaying α | Stabilizes Q-values as they approach optimum |
| Sufficient episodes | All states visited many times |
| Monitor Q-value changes | Stop when changes are small |

**Convergence Indicators:**
- Average reward per episode stabilizes
- Q-value updates become very small
- Policy stops changing

**Note:** In practice, we often stop before true convergence when performance is "good enough."

---

## Question 10

**What are the conditions necessary for Q-learning to find the optimal policy?**

**Answer:**

**Required Conditions:**

**1. Sufficient Exploration**
- Every state-action pair (s,a) must be visited infinitely often
- Ensures all options are evaluated
- Achieved through: ε-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, UCB

**2. Proper Learning Rate Decay**
$$\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \alpha_t = \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \alpha_t^2 < \infty$$
- First condition: enough total learning
- Second condition: updates eventually stabilize

**3. Markov Property (MDP)**
- Next state depends only on current state and action
- Not on history of previous states

**4. Finite State and Action Spaces** (for tabular Q-learning)
- Q-table must be able to store all (s,a) pairs

**5. Stationary Environment**
- Transition probabilities P(s'|s,a) don't change over time
- Reward function R(s,a) remains constant

**6. Discount Factor γ < 1** (for infinite horizon)
- Ensures Q-values are bounded
- Makes algorithm focus on finite-horizon returns

---

**Summary Table:**

| Condition | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Exploration | Visit all states/actions |
| Decaying α | Convergence stability |
| MDP assumption | Valid problem formulation |
| Finite spaces | Tabular representation possible |
| Stationary | Consistent target to learn |
| γ < 1 | Bounded returns |

**If conditions violated:** Q-learning may not converge to optimal policy.

---

## Question 11

**What are common strategies for initializing the Q-table?**

**Answer:**

**Common Initialization Strategies:**

**1. Zero Initialization**
```python
Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))
```
- Simple and most common
- Works well with proper exploration
- May slow initial learning

**2. Random Initialization**
```python
Q = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (num_states, num_actions))
```
- Breaks symmetry
- Encourages initial exploration
- Values should be small

**3. Optimistic Initialization**
```python
Q = np.ones((num_states, num_actions)) * high_value
```
- Initialize with values higher than expected rewards
- Encourages exploration (all actions look promising initially)
- Good for encouraging thorough exploration

**4. Pessimistic Initialization**
```python
Q = np.ones((num_states, num_actions)) * low_value
```
- Conservative estimates
- Agent learns from positive surprises

**5. Prior Knowledge Based**
```python
Q = domain_specific_heuristic()
```
- Use domain expertise to set initial estimates
- Speeds up learning if knowledge is accurate

---

**Comparison:**

| Strategy | Exploration | Learning Speed | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Zero | Neutral | Moderate | Default choice |
| Random | Moderate | Moderate | Breaking symmetry |
| Optimistic | High | Slower initially | Thorough exploration |
| Prior-based | Varies | Fastest | Domain knowledge available |

**Best Practice:**
Optimistic initialization is often recommended as it ensures comprehensive exploration of the state-action space.

---

## Question 12

**What is experience replay in the context of Q-learning, and why is it useful?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Experience replay is a technique where the agent stores past experiences (s, a, r, s') in a buffer (replay memory) and randomly samples mini-batches from it during training, instead of learning only from the most recent experience.

**How It Works:**
```
1. Store experience tuple (s, a, r, s', done) in replay buffer
2. When buffer has enough samples:
   - Randomly sample mini-batch of experiences
   - Use batch to update Q-network
3. Repeat
```

**Replay Buffer Structure:**
```python
replay_buffer = deque(maxlen=100000)
# Each entry: (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
```

---

**Benefits:**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Breaks correlation** | Consecutive experiences are correlated; random sampling reduces this |
| **Sample efficiency** | Each experience used multiple times |
| **Stable learning** | Diverse mini-batches reduce variance |
| **Avoids catastrophic forgetting** | Old experiences revisited |

---

**Key for Deep Q-Networks (DQN):**
Experience replay is crucial for training stability in DQN because:
- Neural networks are sensitive to correlated data
- Sequential updates cause oscillation and divergence
- Random sampling provides i.i.d.-like training data

**Variants:**
- **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Sample important experiences more frequently
- **Hindsight Experience Replay**: Relabel failed experiences with alternative goals

---

## Question 13

**Explain the role of target networks in some Q-learning variants.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
A target network is a separate copy of the Q-network that is updated less frequently, used to compute stable target values during training.

**The Problem Without Target Networks:**
- In DQN, we update Q-network toward: target = r + γ max Q(s', a')
- But Q(s', a') is computed using the same network being updated
- This creates a "moving target" problem → instability

**Solution - Target Network:**
```
Q_network: Updated every step (gradient descent)
Q_target: Updated periodically (copy from Q_network)
```

---

**How It Works:**

```python
# Training step
target = reward + gamma * Q_target(next_state).max()
loss = (Q_network(state, action) - target) ** 2
# Update Q_network via gradient descent

# Every C steps:
Q_target.load_state_dict(Q_network.state_dict())  # Hard update
# OR
Q_target = tau * Q_network + (1-tau) * Q_target  # Soft update
```

---

**Update Strategies:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hard update** | Copy weights every C steps (e.g., C=1000) |
| **Soft update** | Gradual blend: θ_target ← τθ + (1-τ)θ_target (τ~0.001) |

**Benefits:**
- Stable targets during training
- Reduces oscillations and divergence
- Enables convergence of DQN

**Used In:** DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Rainbow DQN

---

## Question 14

**Describe the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and its relation to Q-learning.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
DQN (Deep Q-Network) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces (like images).

**Relationship to Q-Learning:**
- Same core algorithm: Learn Q(s,a) using Bellman updates
- Difference: Uses neural network instead of Q-table

| Tabular Q-Learning | DQN |
|-------------------|-----|
| Q-table lookup | Neural network Q(s,a; θ) |
| Discrete, small states | High-dimensional states (images) |
| Exact storage | Function approximation |
| Guaranteed convergence | May diverge without tricks |

---

**Key Innovations in DQN:**

**1. Experience Replay**
- Store transitions in buffer, sample randomly
- Breaks correlation, improves stability

**2. Target Network**
- Separate network for computing targets
- Updated periodically, provides stable targets

**3. Convolutional Architecture**
- Process raw pixel inputs
- Learns visual features automatically

---

**DQN Architecture:**
```
Input: State (e.g., 84x84x4 stacked frames)
   ↓
Conv layers (feature extraction)
   ↓
Fully connected layers
   ↓
Output: Q-value for each action
```

**Loss Function:**
$$L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a'; \theta^-) - Q(s,a; \theta))^2\right]$$

**Impact:**
DQN achieved human-level performance on Atari games (2015), pioneering deep RL.

---

## Question 15

**How does Double Q-learning aim to reduce overestimation of Q-values?**

**Answer:**

**The Overestimation Problem:**
In standard Q-learning, the max operator causes systematic overestimation:
$$\text{target} = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$$

The max over noisy Q-estimates tends to select overestimated values, leading to:
- Inflated Q-values
- Suboptimal policies
- Unstable learning

---

**Double Q-Learning Solution:**
Use two separate Q-functions to decouple action selection from value estimation.

**Standard Q-Learning:**
$$\text{target} = r + \gamma Q(s', \arg\max_{a'} Q(s', a'))$$
*Same Q used to select and evaluate action*

**Double Q-Learning:**
$$\text{target} = r + \gamma Q_B(s', \arg\max_{a'} Q_A(s', a'))$$
*Q_A selects best action, Q_B evaluates it*

---

**Implementation in Double DQN:**
```python
# Action selection using online network
best_action = Q_online(next_state).argmax()

# Value estimation using target network
target = reward + gamma * Q_target(next_state)[best_action]
```

**Benefits:**

| Standard DQN | Double DQN |
|--------------|------------|
| Overestimates Q-values | More accurate estimates |
| May learn suboptimal policies | Better policy learning |
| Uses max for both selection & evaluation | Decouples selection & evaluation |

**Result:**
Double DQN achieves better performance on Atari games with more stable Q-value estimates.

---

## Question 16

**Explain how Prioritized Experience Replay enhances the training of a Q-learning agent.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) samples experiences from the replay buffer based on their TD error rather than uniformly, prioritizing experiences the agent can learn most from.

**Standard vs Prioritized Replay:**

| Standard Replay | Prioritized Replay |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Uniform random sampling | Priority-based sampling |
| All experiences equal | Important experiences sampled more |
| May waste time on easy examples | Focuses on high-error transitions |

---

**Priority Calculation:**
$$p_i = |\delta_i| + \epsilon$$

Where:
- δ_i = TD error = |r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)|
- ε = small constant (prevents zero priority)

**Sampling Probability:**
$$P(i) = \frac{p_i^\alpha}{\sum_k p_k^\alpha}$$
- α = 0: uniform sampling
- α = 1: pure prioritization

---

**Importance Sampling Correction:**
Prioritized sampling creates bias. Correct with weights:
$$w_i = \left(\frac{1}{N \cdot P(i)}\right)^\beta$$

- β starts low, anneals to 1 during training
- Weights used to scale gradient updates

**Benefits:**
- Faster learning (focus on challenging experiences)
- Better sample efficiency
- Improves performance on complex tasks

**Implementation:**
Uses sum-tree data structure for O(log n) sampling and updates.

**Used In:** Rainbow DQN, PER-DQN

---

## Question 17

**What is Dueling Network Architecture in DQN and how does it differ from traditional DQN?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Dueling DQN separates the Q-value estimation into two streams: one for state value V(s) and one for advantage A(s,a), then combines them.

**Traditional DQN:**
```
Input → Conv/FC layers → Q(s,a) for each action
```

**Dueling DQN:**
```
Input → Conv/FC layers → Split into two streams:
                         ├→ Value stream V(s)
                         └→ Advantage stream A(s,a)
                              ↓
                         Combine: Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a)
```

---

**Key Components:**

**Value Function V(s):**
- How good is it to be in state s?
- Independent of action

**Advantage Function A(s,a):**
- How much better is action a compared to average?
- A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s)

**Combination Formula:**
$$Q(s,a) = V(s) + \left(A(s,a) - \frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{a'} A(s,a')\right)$$

*Subtracting mean advantage ensures identifiability*

---

**Benefits:**

| Aspect | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Learning efficiency** | Learns value of states even when actions don't matter much |
| **Generalization** | Better across similar states |
| **Stability** | More stable Q-value estimates |

**When It Helps:**
- States where action choice doesn't significantly affect outcome
- Improves policy evaluation without needing to evaluate each action

**Used In:** Rainbow DQN, modern RL agents

---

## Question 18

**Explain the role of eligibility traces in Temporal Difference (TD) learning and how it relates to Q-learning.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Eligibility traces are a mechanism that bridges TD learning (one-step updates) and Monte Carlo methods (full-episode updates), allowing credit assignment over multiple time steps.

**The Spectrum:**
```
TD(0) ←――――― TD(λ) ―――――→ Monte Carlo
One-step     λ-weighted      Full episode
             combination
```

---

**How Eligibility Traces Work:**

Each state-action pair has an eligibility trace e(s,a) that:
- Increases when visited
- Decays over time by factor (γλ)

**Update Rule with Traces:**
$$e(s,a) \leftarrow \gamma \lambda \cdot e(s,a) + \mathbb{1}(s_t=s, a_t=a)$$
$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \cdot \delta_t \cdot e(s,a)$$

Where δ_t = TD error = r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)

---

**λ Parameter (0 to 1):**

| λ Value | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| λ = 0 | Pure TD(0), one-step updates |
| λ = 1 | Monte Carlo-like, full returns |
| 0 < λ < 1 | Weighted average of n-step returns |

---

**Relation to Q-Learning:**
- Standard Q-learning is TD(0) - only one-step lookahead
- Q(λ) uses eligibility traces for faster credit assignment
- SARSA(λ) is the on-policy variant with traces

**Benefits:**
- Faster learning for delayed rewards
- Better credit assignment over long sequences
- More efficient than waiting for episode end

---

## Question 19

**What is Rainbow DQN, and which problems in DQN does it address?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Rainbow DQN is a unified deep RL algorithm that combines six key improvements to the original DQN into a single agent, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

**The Six Components:**

| Component | Problem Addressed |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Double Q-learning** | Overestimation of Q-values |
| **Prioritized Replay** | Inefficient uniform sampling |
| **Dueling Networks** | Poor state value estimation |
| **Multi-step Learning** | Slow credit assignment |
| **Distributional RL** | Ignores reward distribution |
| **Noisy Networks** | Inefficient ε-greedy exploration |

---

**Component Details:**

**1. Double DQN:** Decouple action selection from evaluation
**2. Prioritized Experience Replay:** Sample high TD-error transitions more
**3. Dueling Architecture:** Separate V(s) and A(s,a) streams
**4. Multi-step Returns:** n-step TD targets instead of 1-step
$$G_t^{(n)} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \gamma^k r_{t+k} + \gamma^n \max_a Q(s_{t+n}, a)$$
**5. Distributional RL (C51):** Learn distribution of returns, not just mean
**6. Noisy Networks:** Add learnable noise to network weights for exploration

---

**Performance:**
- Achieves superhuman performance on most Atari games
- Ablation studies show each component contributes
- Distributional RL + Prioritized Replay most impactful

**Key Insight:**
These improvements are complementary and combine synergistically.

## Question 20

**How does Q-learning adapt to non-stationary (dynamic) environments?**

**Answer:**

**The Challenge:**
In non-stationary environments, transition probabilities P(s'|s,a) or reward function R(s,a) change over time, violating MDP assumptions.

**Standard Q-learning assumption:** Environment is stationary
**Reality:** Many real-world environments change

---

**Adaptation Strategies:**

**1. Constant Learning Rate**
- Don't decay α to zero
- Keeps agent responsive to changes
- Trade-off: less stability, continued adaptation

**2. Sliding Window Experience Replay**
- Only keep recent experiences in buffer
- Old (outdated) experiences discarded
- Buffer size controls memory horizon

**3. Recency-Weighted Replay**
- Recent experiences sampled with higher probability
- Older experiences gradually forgotten

**4. Context Detection**
- Detect when environment changes (distribution shift)
- Reset or re-initialize Q-values
- Use change-point detection algorithms

**5. Meta-Learning**
- Train agent to adapt quickly to new environments
- MAML, RL² approaches

**6. Partial Reset**
- Reset Q-values for states where TD error spikes
- Indicates environment change in that region

---

**Practical Considerations:**

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Constant α | Slow, continuous change |
| Sliding window | Periodic regime changes |
| Context detection | Abrupt changes |
| Meta-learning | Many related environments |

**Key Trade-off:** Stability vs. adaptability

## Question 21

**Describe how a Q-learning agent could be taught to play a simple video game. What unique challenges might you face?**

**Answer:**

**Approach: Deep Q-Network (DQN)**

**1. State Representation:**
- Raw pixels (e.g., 84×84 grayscale)
- Stack 4 frames to capture motion
- Preprocessing: crop, downsample, normalize

**2. Action Space:**
- Discrete actions (up, down, left, right, fire, etc.)
- Typically 4-18 actions depending on game

**3. Reward Signal:**
- Game score changes
- +1 for positive events, -1 for negative
- Reward shaping if needed

**4. Network Architecture:**
```
Input: 84×84×4 frames
   → Conv layers (extract visual features)
   → Fully connected layers
   → Output: Q-value per action
```

---

**Training Pipeline:**
```
1. Preprocess frame → stack with previous 3 frames
2. ε-greedy action selection
3. Execute action, observe reward and next frame
4. Store (s, a, r, s') in replay buffer
5. Sample batch, compute targets, update network
6. Periodically update target network
```

---

**Unique Challenges:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **High-dimensional input** | CNN for feature extraction |
| **Correlated frames** | Experience replay |
| **Delayed rewards** | Discount factor, n-step returns |
| **Exploration** | ε-decay, noisy networks |
| **Training instability** | Target networks, gradient clipping |
| **Sparse rewards** | Reward shaping, curiosity-driven exploration |
| **Long training time** | GPU acceleration, parallel environments |

**Example Games:** Atari Breakout, Pong, Space Invaders

## Question 22

**What are the current limitations of Q-learning, and how might recent research address these challenges?**

**Answer:**

**Current Limitations:**

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Discrete actions only** | Cannot directly handle continuous action spaces |
| **Sample inefficiency** | Requires millions of interactions |
| **Overestimation bias** | Max operator inflates Q-values |
| **Exploration challenges** | ε-greedy insufficient for complex environments |
| **Scalability** | Large state spaces need function approximation |
| **Stability issues** | Deadly triad: function approx + bootstrapping + off-policy |
| **Reward engineering** | Relies on well-designed reward functions |

## Question 23

**What are some common issues to look out for when debugging a Q-learning agent?**

**Answer:**

**Common Issues and Debugging Strategies:**

**1. Q-Values Exploding or Collapsing**
- **Symptom:** Q-values become very large or all zeros
- **Causes:** High learning rate, no target network, improper reward scaling
- **Fix:** Clip gradients, reduce α, check reward normalization

**2. No Learning Progress**
- **Symptom:** Reward stays constant over episodes
- **Checks:**
  - Is exploration sufficient? (ε too low?)
  - Are Q-values being updated? (log TD errors)
  - Is replay buffer filling correctly?

**3. Unstable Training**
- **Symptom:** Performance oscillates wildly
- **Causes:** Correlated samples, no target network
- **Fix:** Use experience replay, implement target network, reduce learning rate

**4. Overestimation**
- **Symptom:** Q-values much higher than actual returns
- **Fix:** Use Double DQN

**5. Exploration Issues**
- **Symptom:** Agent gets stuck in suboptimal policy
- **Fix:** Increase ε, try different exploration strategies

---

**Debugging Checklist:**

| What to Monitor | What to Look For |
|----------------|------------------|
| Average episode reward | Should increase over time |
| Q-value magnitude | Should be reasonable (not exploding) |
| TD error | Should decrease over time |
| Epsilon value | Ensure proper decay schedule |
| Replay buffer | Sufficient diverse experiences |
| Loss curve | Should generally decrease |

**Useful Logging:**
```python
print(f"Episode {ep}: Reward={total_reward}, Avg_Q={avg_q:.2f}, Epsilon={epsilon:.3f}")
```

**Tips:**
- Start with simple environments (GridWorld) before complex ones
- Visualize Q-values as heatmaps
- Compare against known baselines
