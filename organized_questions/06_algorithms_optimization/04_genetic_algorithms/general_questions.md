# Genetic Algorithms Interview Questions - General Questions

## Question 1

**How can genetic algorithms be applied to combinatorial optimization problems?**

**Answer:**

**Combinatorial Problems:** Discrete solutions where order/selection matters (TSP, scheduling, knapsack).

**Encoding for Common Problems:**

| Problem | Encoding |
|---------|----------|
| **TSP** | Permutation [3,1,4,2,5] = visit order |
| **Knapsack** | Binary [1,0,1,1] = include/exclude |
| **Scheduling** | Permutation or priority list |
| **Graph coloring** | Integer [2,1,3,1,2] = color per node |

**TSP Example:**
```
Chromosome: [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
Meaning: City3 → City1 → City4 → City2 → City5 → City3
Fitness: -total_distance (minimize)
```

**Specialized Operators:**

| Problem | Crossover | Mutation |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Permutation | PMX, OX, CX | Swap, insert, invert |
| Binary | Standard | Bit flip |

**PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover):**
Ensures valid permutations in offspring.

**Advantages of GA:**
- No gradient needed
- Handles discrete decisions
- Explores diverse solutions
- Works with complex constraints

**Best Practices:**
- Choose encoding that makes constraints implicit
- Use problem-specific operators
- Repair invalid solutions if needed

---

## Question 2

**How do 'penalty functions' work in genetic algorithms?**

**Answer:**

**Purpose:** Handle constraints by penalizing invalid solutions.

**Formula:**
$$\text{Fitness}' = \text{Fitness} - \lambda \times \text{Violation}$$

**Types of Penalties:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Static** | Fixed penalty coefficient |
| **Dynamic** | Penalty increases with generations |
| **Adaptive** | Adjusts based on population state |
| **Death** | Infinite penalty (infeasible = fitness 0) |

**Static Penalty:**
```python
def penalized_fitness(x):
    fitness = objective(x)
    violation = max(0, constraint(x))  # 0 if satisfied
    return fitness - penalty_coeff * violation
```

**Dynamic Penalty:**
```python
penalty = base_penalty * (generation / max_gen) ** 2
# Starts low (explore), grows high (enforce)
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Works with any constraint type
- Allows partial exploration of infeasible space

**Disadvantages:**
- Hard to tune penalty coefficient
- Too low → infeasible solutions dominate
- Too high → can't explore near constraint boundary

**Best Practice:**
Start with moderate penalty, use adaptive schemes, or combine with repair operators.

## Question 3

**Define ‘hypermutation’ and its role in GAs.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**

**Hypermutation** is a dramatically increased mutation rate, typically applied temporarily to escape local optima or increase diversity.

**Standard vs Hypermutation:**

| Standard Mutation | Hypermutation |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Rate: 0.01-0.1 | Rate: 0.2-0.5+ |
| Maintain solutions | Disrupt solutions |
| Exploitation | Exploration |

**When to Apply:**

```python
if no_improvement_for(n_generations):
    mutation_rate = hypermutation_rate  # Temporarily high
else:
    mutation_rate = normal_rate
```

**Inspired by Biology:**
Immune system uses hypermutation to generate antibody diversity when fighting new pathogens.

**Applications:**

| Use Case | Why Hypermutation |
|----------|-------------------|
| Stuck in local optimum | Escape current basin |
| Population converged | Reintroduce diversity |
| Dynamic problems | Adapt to changed environment |
| Immune system algorithms | Core mechanism |

**Adaptive Hypermutation:**
```python
# Mutate more if individual is poor
mutation_rate = base_rate * (1 + (1 - normalized_fitness))
# Worse solutions → more mutation
```

**Caution:**
- Use temporarily, not always
- High mutation = random search
- Balance exploration vs exploitation

---

## Question 4

**How do 'generational genetic algorithms' operate?**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**

A **generational GA** replaces the entire population with offspring each generation (as opposed to steady-state which replaces few).

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Evaluate fitness of all individuals
2. Select parents (entire new population)
3. Apply crossover to pairs
4. Apply mutation
5. New offspring REPLACE entire old population
6. Repeat
```

**Characteristics:**

| Aspect | Generational GA |
|--------|-----------------|
| Replacement | 100% per generation |
| Generations | Clear, discrete |
| Parallelization | Easy (all independent) |
| Diversity | Higher (complete turnover) |

**Comparison:**

| Generational | Steady-State |
|--------------|--------------|
| Replace all | Replace 1-2 |
| Clear generations | Continuous |
| More diverse | Better exploitation |
| More disruptive | More gradual |

**With Elitism:**
```python
# Keep best K, replace rest
next_gen = elite[:k] + offspring[:pop_size - k]
```

**When to Use:**
- When parallelization is important
- When diversity is priority
- Standard choice for most applications
- Clear generation count helps debugging

## Question 5

**How do 'diploid' and 'haploid' structures function differently in genetic algorithms?**

**Answer:**

**Biological Background:**
- **Haploid**: One set of chromosomes (standard GA)
- **Diploid**: Two sets of chromosomes (like humans)

**Haploid GA (Standard):**
```
Individual: [A, B, C, D]  ← Single chromosome
```

**Diploid GA:**
```
Individual: 
  Chromosome 1: [A, B, C, D]
  Chromosome 2: [a, b, c, d]
  Expressed phenotype determined by dominance
```

**Dominance:**
If A is dominant over a, phenotype shows A.
Recessive alleles are "hidden" but preserved.

**Benefits of Diploid:**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Stores alternative alleles |
| **Robustness** | Adapts to changing environments |
| **Diversity** | Maintains hidden variation |

**Use Case - Dynamic Environments:**
- Environment changes periodically
- Recessive alleles from old environment preserved
- When environment returns, hidden alleles express quickly

**Complexity:**
- More complex operators needed
- Dominance rules must be defined
- Higher computational cost

**When to Use:**
- Non-stationary optimization
- Environment changes cyclically
- Need "genetic memory"

## Question 6

**How could you use GAs in feature selection for a predictive model?**

**Answer:**

**Encoding:**
```
Binary chromosome: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, ...]
Length = number of features
1 = include feature, 0 = exclude
```

**Fitness Function:**
```python
def fitness(chromosome):
    selected = [i for i, b in enumerate(chromosome) if b == 1]
    X_subset = X[:, selected]
    
    # Cross-validation accuracy
    score = cross_val_score(model, X_subset, y, cv=5).mean()
    
    # Penalty for too many features
    n_features = sum(chromosome)
    penalty = alpha * n_features / total_features
    
    return score - penalty
```

**Operators:**
- Crossover: Uniform or single-point
- Mutation: Bit flip with low probability

**Advantages over Sequential Methods:**

| GA | Forward/Backward Selection |
|----|---------------------------|
| Explores combinations | Greedy, local |
| Finds interactions | Misses interactions |
| Parallel | Sequential |

**Practical Tips:**
1. Initialize with sparse solutions (few 1s)
2. Use fast model for fitness (RandomForest, LogisticRegression)
3. Tune penalty to control feature count
4. Use elitism to preserve good subsets
5. Early stopping when no improvement

## Question 7

**What strategies can be employed to maintain diversity in a GA population?**

**Answer:**

**Diversity Maintenance Strategies:**

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Fitness sharing** | Reduce fitness in crowded regions |
| **Crowding** | Replace similar individuals |
| **Island model** | Separate subpopulations |
| **Random immigrants** | Inject new random solutions |
| **Restricted mating** | Only dissimilar can mate |
| **Niching** | Maintain multiple optima |

**Implementation Examples:**

**Fitness Sharing:**
```python
shared_fitness = fitness / (1 + count_neighbors_within_radius)
```

**Random Immigrants:**
```python
# Each generation, replace worst 5% with random
population[-n_immigrants:] = generate_random(n_immigrants)
```

**Diversity Monitoring:**
```python
diversity = np.mean([distance(pop[i], pop[j]) 
                     for i,j in combinations(range(len(pop)), 2)])
if diversity < threshold:
    increase_mutation_rate()
```

**Best Practices:**
1. Monitor diversity metrics during evolution
2. Adapt mutation rate based on diversity
3. Use island model for natural diversity
4. Balance diversity vs convergence speed

## Question 8

**How can GAs be used in job scheduling and resource allocation problems?**

**Answer:**

**Problem:** Assign jobs to machines/time slots to minimize makespan or cost.

**Encoding Options:**

| Encoding | Representation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Permutation** | Job order [3,1,4,2] |
| **Priority-based** | Priority values per job |
| **Direct** | Machine assignment per job |

**Example - Job Shop:**
```
Chromosome: [2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Meaning: Job0→Machine2, Job1→Machine0, ...
```

**Fitness Function:**
```python
def fitness(schedule):
    makespan = simulate_schedule(schedule)
    return -makespan  # Minimize
```

**Constraints:**
- Precedence (Job A before Job B)
- Resource limits
- Time windows

**Handling:**
- Repair operator: Fix invalid schedules
- Penalty for constraint violations
- Decoder: Always produce valid schedules

**Advantages:**
- Handles complex constraints
- Multi-objective (time, cost, balance)
- Works with non-linear objectives
- Can optimize NP-hard problems

**Applications:**
- Manufacturing scheduling
- Cloud resource allocation
- Employee shift scheduling
- Project task assignment

## Question 9

**How do you determine suitable crossover and mutation rates for a genetic algorithm?**

**Answer:**

**Typical Ranges:**

| Operator | Typical Rate | Range |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Crossover** | 0.7-0.9 | 0.5-1.0 |
| **Mutation** | 0.01-0.1 | 0.001-0.5 |

**Factors Affecting Choice:**

| Factor | High Rate | Low Rate |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Crossover** | More exploration | Preserve good solutions |
| **Mutation** | Escape local optima | Maintain good genes |

**Tuning Approaches:**

**1. Grid Search:**
```python
for cx_rate in [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]:
    for mut_rate in [0.01, 0.05, 0.1]:
        run_ga(crossover=cx_rate, mutation=mut_rate)
```

**2. Adaptive Rates:**
```python
# Decrease mutation as population converges
mutation_rate = initial_rate * (1 - generation/max_gen)
```

**3. Self-Adaptive:**
Include rates in chromosome, evolve them too!

**Guidelines:**
- Binary: Lower mutation (0.01/bit)
- Real-valued: Higher mutation (0.1-0.2)
- Small population: Higher mutation
- Multimodal: Higher rates for exploration

**Best Practice:**
Start with 0.8 crossover, 0.05 mutation. Monitor convergence. Increase mutation if stuck, decrease if oscillating.

## Question 10

**How should one go about choosing a fitness function for a particular GA application?**

**Answer:**

**Key Considerations:**

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Discriminating** | Differentiates good from bad |
| **Efficient** | Fast to compute |
| **Aligned** | Measures what you care about |
| **Bounded** | Reasonable numerical range |

**Design Process:**

1. **Define objective clearly**
   - What makes a solution "good"?
   - Single or multiple objectives?

2. **Handle constraints**
   - Penalty terms for violations
   - Or repair to make feasible

3. **Scale appropriately**
   - Avoid fitness values of 0 (division issues)
   - Normalize if needed

**Examples:**

| Problem | Fitness Function |
|---------|------------------|
| Minimize error | f = 1/(1 + MSE) |
| Maximize accuracy | f = accuracy |
| Multi-objective | f = w1*obj1 + w2*obj2 |
| With constraints | f = objective - λ*violation |

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Fitness doesn't reflect true goal
- Premature convergence (fitness too discriminating)
- Stagnation (fitness too flat)
- Expensive to compute

**Testing:**
- Check gradient of improvement exists
- Verify ranking matches intuition
- Test with known good/bad solutions

## Question 11

**Present a strategy to use GAs for evolving decision rules in a rule-based system.**

**Answer:**

**Problem:** Evolve IF-THEN rules for classification or decision-making.

**Rule Representation:**
```
IF (Age > 30) AND (Income > 50000) THEN Class = 1
```

**Encoding Options:**

**1. Pittsburgh Approach:**
- Each chromosome = complete rule set
- Evolve entire rule bases

**2. Michigan Approach:**
- Each chromosome = single rule
- Population is the rule set

**Pittsburgh Encoding:**
```
Chromosome: [Rule1, Rule2, Rule3]
Rule: [condition1, condition2, ..., action]
```

**Fitness Function:**
```python
def fitness(rule_set):
    accuracy = evaluate_on_data(rule_set, X, y)
    complexity = count_conditions(rule_set)
    return accuracy - alpha * complexity
```

**Operators:**
- **Crossover**: Exchange rules between sets
- **Mutation**: Modify conditions, thresholds, actions

**Advantages:**
- Interpretable rules (unlike black-box)
- Can discover complex interactions
- Handles symbolic and numeric data

**Example Result:**
```
IF (Credit_Score < 600) AND (Debt_Ratio > 0.4) THEN Deny
IF (Income > 100000) THEN Approve
```

## Question 12

**How can ‘reinforcement learning’ be integrated with genetic algorithms?**

**Answer:**

**Integration Approaches:**

**1. Evolve RL Policies:**
```
Chromosome = neural network weights
Fitness = cumulative reward in environment
No gradient needed → works for non-differentiable rewards
```

**2. Evolve Reward Shaping:**
```
Chromosome = reward function parameters
GA finds reward that produces desired behavior
```

**3. Neuroevolution for RL:**
- NEAT: Evolve network topology + weights
- ES (Evolution Strategies): Population of policies
- Example: OpenAI ES for Atari games

**Comparison:**

| GA/ES for RL | Gradient RL (PPO, A3C) |
|--------------|------------------------|
| No gradients | Needs differentiable |
| Parallel evaluation | Sequential updates |
| Explore diverse policies | May converge to one |
| Simpler to implement | More sample efficient |

**Hybrid Approach:**
```
GA: Explore diverse policy architectures
RL: Fine-tune weights with gradients
```

**Practical Example - Game AI:**
```python
def fitness(network_weights):
    agent = create_agent(weights)
    total_reward = 0
    for episode in range(10):
        total_reward += play_game(agent)
    return total_reward / 10
```

**When to Use:**
- Sparse/delayed rewards
- Non-differentiable environments
- Want diverse solution set

    ('pool', 2),       # Max pool
    ('dense', 128),    # Dense layer
    ('dropout', 0.5)   # Dropout
]
fitness = train_and_evaluate(chromosome)
```

**Comparison with Gradient-Based:**

| GA for Feature Learning | Backprop |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Structure search | Weight optimization |
| Discrete choices | Continuous |
| Global exploration | Local refinement |
| No differentiability needed | Needs gradients |

**Practical Workflow:**

chromosome = {
    'learning_rate': 0.001,
    'batch_size': 32,
    'optimizer': 'adam',
    'layers': 3,
    'dropout': 0.5
}
```

**Fitness Function:**
```python
def fitness(hyperparams):
    model = build_model(hyperparams)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
    return model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
```

**Advantages Over Grid/Random:**

| Method | Evaluations | Quality |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Grid | Exponential | Exhaustive but slow |
| Random | Many | Hit or miss |
| GA | Guided search | Efficient exploration |

**Handling Mixed Types:**

- Discrete: num_layers (integer mutation)
- Categorical: optimizer (random choice mutation)

**Parallel Evaluation:**
```python
# Evaluate population in parallel
with Pool(num_gpus) as pool:
    fitness_values = pool.map(evaluate, population)
```

**Best Practices:**
1. Use early stopping to speed up fitness evaluation
2. Start with wide ranges, narrow down
3. Include architecture choices too
4. Use validation set, not test set

**Tools:** DEAP, PyGAD, TPOT, genetic algorithms in Optuna
