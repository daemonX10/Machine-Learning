# Light Gbm Interview Questions - Scenario_Based Questions

## Question 1

**Discuss the types of tree learners available in LightGBM.**

**Answer:**

**Tree Learners (tree_learner parameter):**

**1. Serial (Default for single machine)**
```python
params = {'tree_learner': 'serial'}
```
- Standard single-machine training
- All features and data on one node
- Best for: small to medium datasets

**2. Feature Parallel**
```python
params = {'tree_learner': 'feature'}
```
- Distributes features across workers
- Each worker finds best split for its features
- Communication: share split decisions
- Best for: many features, few workers

**3. Data Parallel**
```python
params = {'tree_learner': 'data'}
```
- Distributes data (rows) across workers
- Each worker builds local histogram
- Communication: aggregate histograms
- Best for: many rows, distributed training

**4. Voting Parallel**
```python
params = {'tree_learner': 'voting'}
```
- Hybrid of data and feature parallel
- Workers vote on top features
- Only aggregate histograms for winning features
- Best for: large-scale distributed training, reduces communication

---

**Comparison:**

| Learner | Best For | Communication Cost |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Serial | Single machine | None |
| Feature | Many features | Low (split points) |
| Data | Many rows | High (histograms) |
| Voting | Very large scale | Medium (voting + selected histograms) |

**Usage Example:**
```python
params = {
    'tree_learner': 'data',
    'num_machines': 4,
    'local_listen_port': 12345
}
```

---

## Question 2

**How would you tune the number of leaves or maximum depth of trees in LightGBM?**

**Answer:**

**Relationship Between Parameters:**
- `num_leaves`: Maximum number of leaves per tree (LightGBM primary control)
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of tree (secondary constraint)

**Rule of thumb:** num_leaves ≤ 2^max_depth

---

**Tuning Approach:**

**1. Start with num_leaves (Primary)**
```python
# Default = 31, try range based on data size
num_leaves_options = [15, 31, 63, 127, 255]
```

**2. Use max_depth as safety limit**
```python
params = {
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'max_depth': 6  # Prevents overly deep trees
}
```

---

**Guidelines by Dataset Size:**

| Dataset Size | num_leaves | max_depth |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Small (<10K) | 15-31 | 4-6 |
| Medium (10K-100K) | 31-63 | 6-8 |
| Large (>100K) | 63-255 | 8-12 or -1 |

---

**Tuning Process:**
```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    params = {
        'num_leaves': trial.suggest_int('num_leaves', 20, 150),
        'max_depth': trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 3, 12),
    }
    # Ensure consistency
    if params['num_leaves'] > 2**params['max_depth']:
        params['num_leaves'] = 2**params['max_depth']
    
    cv_result = lgb.cv(params, train_data, nfold=5)
    return cv_result['auc-mean'][-1]
```

**Trade-offs:**

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| More leaves | Higher accuracy, risk overfitting |
| Fewer leaves | Lower accuracy, better generalization |
| Deep trees | Capture complex patterns |
| Shallow trees | Simpler, more robust |

---

## Question 3

**Discuss the impact of using a large versus small bagging_fraction in LightGBM.**

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
`bagging_fraction` (or `subsample`) controls what fraction of training data is used to train each tree. Value between 0 and 1.

---

**Impact Comparison:**

| Aspect | Large (0.9-1.0) | Small (0.5-0.7) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Data per tree | More data | Less data |
| Variance | Lower | Higher |
| Overfitting risk | Higher | Lower |
| Training speed | Slower | Faster |
| Bias | Lower | Slightly higher |

---

**Detailed Effects:**

**Large bagging_fraction (0.9-1.0):**
- Each tree sees almost all data
- Trees are more similar to each other
- Lower randomness, may overfit
- Better for small datasets

**Small bagging_fraction (0.5-0.7):**
- Each tree sees only a subset
- More diverse trees
- Regularization effect (reduces overfitting)
- Better for large datasets

---

**Usage:**
```python
params = {
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,  # Use 80% of data per tree
    'bagging_freq': 5         # Apply bagging every 5 iterations
}
```

**Note:** Must set `bagging_freq > 0` for bagging_fraction to take effect.

---

**Recommended Settings:**

| Scenario | bagging_fraction |
|----------|-----------------|
| Small data, underfitting | 0.9-1.0 |
| Large data, default | 0.8 |
| Overfitting concerns | 0.6-0.7 |
| Very large data | 0.5-0.6 |

**Combined with feature_fraction:**
```python
params = {
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'feature_fraction': 0.8  # Also subsample features
}
```

---

## Question 4

**Discuss the support of weight-based sampling in LightGBM.**

**Answer:**

**Weight-Based Sampling Support:**
LightGBM supports instance weights for various purposes including handling imbalanced data and importance weighting.

---

**Methods:**

**1. Instance Weights**
```python
# Assign weights to each sample
train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train, weight=sample_weights)
```

**Use cases:**
- Imbalanced classes (higher weight for minority)
- Recent data more important
- Business importance of samples

**2. Class Weights (for imbalanced data)**
```python
params = {
    'is_unbalance': True  # Auto-weight based on class frequency
}
# OR
params = {
    'scale_pos_weight': 10  # Weight for positive class
}
```

**3. GOSS (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling)**
```python
params = {
    'boosting_type': 'goss',
    'top_rate': 0.2,      # Keep top 20% by gradient
    'other_rate': 0.1     # Sample 10% of rest
}
```
- Weights samples by gradient magnitude
- Automatic, not manual

---

**Example: Custom Weights for Imbalanced Data**
```python
# Calculate weights
weights = np.where(y_train == 1, 
                   len(y_train) / (2 * sum(y_train)),
                   len(y_train) / (2 * (len(y_train) - sum(y_train))))

train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train, weight=weights)
```

---

**Impact of Weights:**
- Loss is weighted: $L = \sum_i w_i \cdot l(y_i, \hat{y}_i)$
- Higher weight samples influence splits more
- Affects tree structure and predictions

**Note:** Use `sample_weight` in sklearn API:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=weights)
```

---

## Question 5

**How would you use LightGBM to predict customer churn based on usage data?**

**Answer:**

**Problem Setup:**
Binary classification - predict if customer will churn (1) or stay (0)

---

**Feature Engineering:**

| Feature Category | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| Usage patterns | Logins/month, feature usage, session duration |
| Engagement | Days since last activity, support tickets |
| Financial | Monthly spend, payment delays |
| Demographics | Account age, plan type |
| Trend features | Usage change (this month vs last 3 months) |

---

**Model Building:**

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)

# Handle imbalance
params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': ['auc', 'binary_logloss'],
    'is_unbalance': True,  # Weight minority class
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'feature_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_fraction': 0.8,
    'bagging_freq': 5
}

# Train with early stopping
train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train, categorical_feature=cat_cols)
valid_data = lgb.Dataset(X_val, label=y_val, categorical_feature=cat_cols)

model = lgb.train(
    params,
    train_data,
    valid_sets=[valid_data],
    num_boost_round=1000,
    early_stopping_rounds=50
)

# Predict churn probability
churn_prob = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

**Evaluation:**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, precision_recall_curve

auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, churn_prob)
```

**Business Application:**
- Rank customers by churn probability
- Target high-risk customers with retention offers
- Analyze feature importance for actionable insights

## Question 7

**Propose a methodology for using LightGBM to detect anomalies in time-series sensor data.**

**Answer:**

**Approach: Supervised Anomaly Detection**
Frame as binary classification (normal vs anomaly) or regression (predict normal, flag deviations).

---

**Methodology:**

**1. Feature Engineering (Time-Series)**

| Feature Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Statistical | Rolling mean, std, min, max |
| Temporal | Hour, day of week, season |
| Lag features | Value at t-1, t-2, ..., t-n |
| Rate of change | First/second derivatives |
| Frequency | FFT components, spectral features |

```python
# Create features
df['rolling_mean'] = df['sensor'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['rolling_std'] = df['sensor'].rolling(window=10).std()
df['lag_1'] = df['sensor'].shift(1)
df['diff'] = df['sensor'].diff()
```

**2. Model Training**

```python
# If labeled data available
params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'is_unbalance': True,  # Anomalies are rare
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05
}

model = lgb.train(params, train_data, 
                  valid_sets=[valid_data],
                  early_stopping_rounds=50)
```

**3. Alternative: Regression-Based Anomaly**
```python
# Predict expected value, flag large residuals
params = {'objective': 'regression'}
model = lgb.train(params, train_data)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
residuals = np.abs(y_test - predictions)
anomalies = residuals > threshold  # e.g., 3 std
```
