# Neural Networks Interview Questions - Scenario-Based Questions

## Question 1: Importance of data augmentation in training neural networks

### Why It's Important
Data augmentation artificially increases training data diversity by applying transformations, helping neural networks generalize better and reducing overfitting.

### Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reduces Overfitting** | More diverse training examples |
| **Improves Generalization** | Model sees variations it might encounter |
| **Cost-Effective** | No need to collect more data |
| **Regularization Effect** | Acts as implicit regularizer |

### Common Techniques (Images)
- Rotation, flipping, cropping
- Color jittering, brightness adjustment
- Random erasing, cutout
- Mixup, CutMix

### When to Use
- Limited training data
- Model overfitting
- Want more robust predictions

## Question 2: GANs and their typical applications

### Architecture
- **Generator**: Creates fake samples from noise
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes real from fake
- Trained adversarially until generator fools discriminator

### Applications

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Image Generation** | StyleGAN for realistic faces |
| **Image-to-Image** | Pix2Pix, CycleGAN |
| **Super-Resolution** | SRGAN for image upscaling |
| **Data Augmentation** | Generate synthetic training data |
| **Art/Design** | Creative content generation |

### Challenges
- Training instability
- Mode collapse
- Hard to evaluate quality

## Question 3: SGD vs Mini-batch Gradient Descent

### Comparison

| Aspect | SGD (1 sample) | Mini-batch (32-256 samples) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Update Frequency** | After each sample | After each batch |
| **Noise** | Very high | Moderate |
| **Convergence** | Noisy, can escape local minima | More stable |
| **GPU Utilization** | Poor | Good |
| **Memory** | Low | Higher |

### Recommendation
Mini-batch is the default for deep learning:
- Balances noise (helps escape) with stability
- Efficient GPU utilization
- Typical sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256

## Question 4: Tackling overfitting in deep neural networks

### Strategy (Priority Order)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Collect more data (if possible) |
| **2** | Data augmentation |
| **3** | Early stopping |
| **4** | Dropout (0.2-0.5) |
| **5** | L2 regularization (weight decay) |
| **6** | Reduce model capacity |
| **7** | Batch normalization |

### Diagnosis
- Training accuracy >> Validation accuracy
- Validation loss increases while training loss decreases

### Code Example
```python
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.5),
    nn.Linear(256, 10)
)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), weight_decay=1e-4)
```

## Question 5: Implications of batch size on training

### Effects

| Batch Size | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Small (16-32)** | More noise, better generalization, slower |
| **Large (256+)** | Less noise, faster training, may generalize worse |

### Trade-offs

| Aspect | Small Batch | Large Batch |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Gradient Estimate** | Noisy | Accurate |
| **Training Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Memory** | Less | More |
| **Generalization** | Often better | May need tuning |

### Practical Tips
- Start with 32 or 64
- Increase if GPU memory allows
- Scale learning rate with batch size
- Large batch may need learning rate warmup

## Question 6: Gradient tracking loss and solutions

### Problem: Vanishing/Exploding Gradients
Gradients become too small or too large during backpropagation, preventing learning.

### Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Vanishing Gradients** | ReLU activation, skip connections, batch norm |
| **Exploding Gradients** | Gradient clipping, proper initialization |
| **Both** | LSTM/GRU for sequences, careful architecture |

### Code Example
```python
# Gradient clipping
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

# Proper initialization
nn.init.kaiming_normal_(layer.weight, mode='fan_in', nonlinearity='relu')
```

## Question 7: CNNs vs Capsule Networks

### Comparison

| Aspect | CNN | Capsule Network |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **Unit Output** | Scalar (feature presence) | Vector (pose information) |
| **Spatial Hierarchy** | Learned implicitly | Explicit part-whole |
| **Translation** | Invariance (pooling) | Equivariance |
| **Maturity** | Well-established | Still experimental |
| **Compute** | Efficient | More expensive |

### Key Difference
Capsules preserve spatial relationships between features (e.g., knowing a face has eyes above nose, not just that eyes and nose exist).

## Question 8: Challenges of sequence modeling

### Main Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Long-range Dependencies** | Remembering distant information |
| **Variable Length** | Different sequence lengths |
| **Vanishing Gradients** | RNNs struggle with long sequences |
| **Sequential Processing** | Slow (can't parallelize) |
| **Alignment** | For tasks like translation |

### Solutions
- LSTM/GRU for vanishing gradients
- Attention mechanisms for long-range
- Transformers for parallelization
- Padding/masking for variable length

---

## Question 9: Sequence padding importance and effects

### Why Padding is Needed
Batching requires same-length sequences; padding fills shorter sequences to match the longest.

### Effects on Performance

| Effect | How to Handle |
|--------|---------------|
| **Wasted Computation** | Use masking to ignore pad tokens |
| **Corrupted Statistics** | Mask in batch norm/attention |
| **Memory** | Truncate very long sequences |

### Implementation
```python
# Padding with masking
padded = nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence(sequences, batch_first=True, padding_value=0)
# Create mask
mask = (padded != 0)
```
