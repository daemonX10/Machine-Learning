# Unsupervised Learning - Theory Questions

## Question 1: Describe the K-means clustering algorithm and how it operates.

### Definition
K-means partitions data into K non-overlapping clusters by minimizing within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**: Choose K random points as initial centroids
2. **Assignment**: Assign each point to nearest centroid
3. **Update**: Recalculate centroids as mean of assigned points
4. **Repeat**: Continue until assignments stop changing

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Requires K** | Must specify number of clusters upfront |
| **Sensitive to Init** | Run multiple times with different initializations |
| **Cluster Shape** | Assumes spherical, equal-sized clusters |
| **Complexity** | O(n × k × iterations) |

### Finding Optimal K
- **Elbow Method**: Plot WCSS vs K, find "elbow" point
- **Silhouette Score**: Maximize separation between clusters

---

## Question 2: What is the role of the silhouette coefficient in clustering analysis?

### Definition
Silhouette coefficient measures how well-separated clusters are and how similar each point is to its own cluster vs others.

### Formula

For each point i:
$$s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(a(i), b(i))}$$

Where:
- **a(i)** = mean distance to points in same cluster (cohesion)
- **b(i)** = mean distance to points in nearest other cluster (separation)

### Interpretation

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **+1** | Well-clustered, far from neighbors |
| **0** | On boundary between clusters |
| **-1** | Likely assigned to wrong cluster |

### Use Case
Run clustering for K = 2, 3, 4... Choose K with highest average silhouette score.

---

## Question 3: Explain the DBSCAN algorithm. What advantages does it offer over K-means?

### Definition
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) groups points based on density, not distance to centroids.

### Parameters
- **eps (ε)**: Radius of neighborhood
- **min_samples**: Minimum points to form a dense region

### Point Types
- **Core Point**: Has ≥ min_samples within eps radius
- **Border Point**: Within eps of core point, but not a core itself
- **Noise Point**: Neither core nor border (outlier)

### Advantages Over K-means

| DBSCAN | K-means |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ No need to specify K | ❌ Requires K upfront |
| ✅ Finds arbitrary shapes | ❌ Only spherical clusters |
| ✅ Robust to outliers (labels as noise) | ❌ Outliers distort centroids |
| ✅ Handles varying densities | ❌ Assumes similar density |

### Disadvantage
Sensitive to eps and min_samples parameter choices.

---

## Question 4: How does the hierarchical clustering algorithm work, and when would you use it?

### Definition
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram) showing nested groupings at different similarity levels.

### Agglomerative (Bottom-Up) Algorithm

1. **Start**: Each point is its own cluster (N clusters)
2. **Find**: Two closest clusters
3. **Merge**: Combine them into one cluster
4. **Repeat**: Until all points in one cluster

### Linkage Criteria (How to measure cluster distance)

| Linkage | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Single** | Distance between closest points |
| **Complete** | Distance between farthest points |
| **Average** | Average distance between all pairs |
| **Ward's** | Minimize variance increase (most popular) |

### When to Use
- Don't know number of clusters beforehand
- Need to understand relationships between clusters
- Smaller datasets (expensive for large N)

---

## Question 5: What is the difference between Agglomerative and Divisive hierarchical clustering?

### Comparison

| Feature | Agglomerative | Divisive |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Direction** | Bottom-up | Top-down |
| **Start** | N clusters (each point) | 1 cluster (all points) |
| **Operation** | Merge similar | Split dissimilar |
| **Complexity** | O(n² log n) | O(2ⁿ) |
| **Common Use** | Very common | Less common |

### Analogy
- **Agglomerative**: Building family tree from individuals upward
- **Divisive**: Organizing library: "All books" → "Fiction/Non-fiction" → subcategories

---

## Question 6: Explain the working of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Definition
PCA transforms correlated features into uncorrelated **principal components** that capture maximum variance.

### Intuition
- Find direction of maximum variance → PC1
- Find perpendicular direction with max remaining variance → PC2
- Continue for all dimensions

### Mathematical Steps

1. **Standardize**: Scale data to mean=0, std=1
2. **Covariance Matrix**: Compute covariance between all feature pairs
3. **Eigendecomposition**: Find eigenvectors (directions) and eigenvalues (variance magnitudes)
4. **Select Components**: Keep top k eigenvectors by eigenvalue
5. **Transform**: Project data onto new k-dimensional space

### Key Points
- Eigenvectors = Principal Components (new axes)
- Eigenvalues = Variance captured by each component
- Often computed via SVD for numerical stability

---

## Question 7: Describe t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and its use cases.

### Definition
t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for **visualization** that preserves local neighborhood structure.

### How It Works

1. **High-D**: Model probability of neighbors using Gaussian distribution
2. **Low-D**: Model probability using t-distribution (heavier tails)
3. **Minimize**: KL divergence between the two distributions via gradient descent

### Use Cases
- Visualizing word embeddings (Word2Vec)
- Visualizing CNN feature layers
- Exploring genomic data clusters

### Important Limitations

| Limitation | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Not for clustering** | Use for visualization only |
| **Global structure not preserved** | Cluster sizes/distances not meaningful |
| **Slow** | Expensive for large datasets; use PCA first |
| **Perplexity sensitive** | Results vary with hyperparameter |

---

## Question 8: How does Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) differ from PCA, and when would you use each?

### Core Difference

| | PCA | LDA |
|---|-----|-----|
| **Type** | Unsupervised | Supervised |
| **Goal** | Maximize variance | Maximize class separability |
| **Uses Labels?** | No | Yes |
| **Max Components** | p (number of features) | C-1 (number of classes - 1) |

### When to Use

**Use PCA when:**
- Unsupervised exploration/visualization
- Feature reduction before any model
- De-noising data

**Use LDA when:**
- Dimensionality reduction for classification
- Want features that best separate known classes

---

## Question 9: What is the curse of dimensionality and how does it affect machine learning models?

### Definition
Problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data due to exponentially increasing volume.

### Effects on ML Models

| Effect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Data Sparsity** | Fixed data becomes spread out; hard to find patterns |
| **Meaningless Distances** | All points become roughly equidistant |
| **Overfitting** | More features = more spurious correlations |
| **Computational Cost** | Exponentially more compute needed |

### Mitigation
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, Autoencoders
- **Feature Selection**: Remove irrelevant features
- **More Data**: If possible, collect more samples

---

## Question 10: Explain what an autoencoder is and how it can be used for dimensionality reduction.

### Definition
An autoencoder is a neural network that learns to compress (encode) input into a latent representation, then reconstruct (decode) it.

### Architecture
```
Input → Encoder → Bottleneck (Latent Space) → Decoder → Reconstructed Output
```

### Training
- Minimize reconstruction loss: MSE(X, X')
- Bottleneck forces network to learn efficient compression

### For Dimensionality Reduction
1. Train autoencoder on data
2. Discard decoder
3. Use encoder output as low-dimensional representation

### Autoencoder vs PCA

| | PCA | Autoencoder |
|---|-----|-------------|
| **Transformation** | Linear | Non-linear (with activations) |
| **Complexity** | Simple, analytical | Neural network, gradient descent |
| **Power** | Limited to linear patterns | Can learn complex manifolds |

### Other Use Cases
- Denoising
- Anomaly detection (high reconstruction error = anomaly)
- Generative models (VAEs)

---

## Question 11: What is association rule mining and how is it relevant to unsupervised learning?

### Definition
Association rule mining discovers relationships of the form "If A, then B" in transaction data.

### Classic Example: Market Basket Analysis
- Data: Customer transactions
- Rule: {Diapers} → {Beer}
- Insight: Customers who buy diapers often buy beer

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Support** | P(A ∩ B) | How frequent is itemset? |
| **Confidence** | P(A ∩ B) / P(A) | How reliable is rule? |
| **Lift** | Support(A,B) / (Support(A) × Support(B)) | Is relationship real or coincidence? |

### Lift Interpretation
- **Lift > 1**: Positive correlation (useful rule)
- **Lift = 1**: Independent (no relationship)
- **Lift < 1**: Negative correlation

---

## Question 12: Explain the Apriori algorithm for association rule learning.

### Core Principle
"If an itemset is frequent, all its subsets are frequent."
Contrapositive: "If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets are infrequent."

### Algorithm

**Stage 1: Find Frequent Itemsets**
1. Scan data → find frequent 1-itemsets (L₁)
2. Generate candidate 2-itemsets from L₁
3. Prune candidates with infrequent subsets
4. Scan data → find frequent 2-itemsets (L₂)
5. Repeat until no new frequent itemsets

**Stage 2: Generate Rules**
- For each frequent itemset, generate rules
- Keep rules meeting min_confidence threshold

### Disadvantage
Requires multiple database scans (one per level k) → slow for large datasets.

---

## Question 13: Discuss the concepts of support, confidence, and lift in association rule learning.

### For Rule: {A} → {B}

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Support** | P(A ∩ B) | How frequent is itemset? |
| **Confidence** | P(A ∩ B) / P(A) | Given A, how likely is B? |
| **Lift** | Support(A,B) / (Support(A) × Support(B)) | Is relationship real or coincidence? |

### Example: {Diapers} → {Beer}

- **Support = 0.1**: 10% of transactions have both
- **Confidence = 0.8**: 80% of diaper buyers also buy beer
- **Lift = 2.0**: Diaper buyers are 2× more likely to buy beer than average customer

### Lift Interpretation

| Lift | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **> 1** | Positive correlation (useful rule) |
| **= 1** | Independent (no relationship) |
| **< 1** | Negative correlation (substitute products) |

### Why Confidence Alone Isn't Enough
High confidence {X} → {Bread} might just mean bread is very popular (appears in 90% of transactions), not that X drives bread purchases. Lift corrects for this.

---

## Question 14: Can you describe the FP-Growth algorithm and how it improves over the Apriori algorithm?

### Improvement Over Apriori
- **Apriori**: Multiple database scans, expensive candidate generation
- **FP-Growth**: Only 2 scans, no candidate generation

### How It Works

**Step 1: Build FP-Tree (2 scans)**
1. First scan: Find support for each item
2. Sort items by frequency, filter by min_support
3. Second scan: Insert transactions into prefix tree

**Step 2: Mine FP-Tree**
- Extract frequent patterns directly from compact tree
- Use divide-and-conquer approach

### Advantages

| FP-Growth | Apriori |
|-----------|---------|
| 2 database scans | k+1 scans |
| No candidate generation | Generates/tests many candidates |
| Compact tree structure | Memory-intensive |

---

## Question 15: How can association rule learning be applied in a market-basket analysis?

### The Process

1. **Data**: Transaction database (items bought together)
2. **Algorithm**: Apriori or FP-Growth
3. **Output**: Rules like {Diapers} → {Beer}

### Business Applications

| Application | Insight | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Store Layout** | Diapers → Beer association | Place beer near diapers |
| **Cross-selling** | Steak → Red Wine | Recommend wine at checkout |
| **Product Bundling** | Printer, Ink, Paper | Create "Home Office Kit" |
| **Loss-Leader Strategy** | Milk appears with high-margin items | Discount milk to draw customers |

### Metrics Used
- **Support**: How frequent is the itemset?
- **Confidence**: How reliable is the rule?
- **Lift**: Is the relationship real or coincidence?

---

## Question 16: Discuss the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its application in clustering.

### Definition
EM is an iterative algorithm for finding maximum likelihood estimates when there are latent (hidden) variables.

### Application: Training GMMs

**The Problem**: We don't know which Gaussian generated each point (latent variable)

### The Two Steps

**E-Step (Expectation)**:
- Given current parameters, calculate probability each point belongs to each Gaussian
- "Soft assignment" based on current beliefs

**M-Step (Maximization)**:
- Given soft assignments, update parameters to maximize likelihood
- New μ = weighted average of points
- New Σ = weighted covariance
- New π = average responsibility

### The Loop
```
Initialize parameters randomly
Repeat:
    E-step: Calculate responsibilities (who generated what?)
    M-step: Update parameters (what are the Gaussians?)
Until convergence
```

### Analogy
- **E-step**: "Based on my theory, what's probability this evidence belongs to Suspect A vs B?"
- **M-step**: "Update my theory about suspects based on these probabilities"

---

## Question 17: What are Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and how do they relate to clustering?

### Definition
GMM assumes data is generated from a mixture of K Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.

### Soft Clustering
Unlike K-means (hard assignment), GMM provides **probability** of belonging to each cluster.

### Parameters Learned
- **μ (mean)**: Center of each Gaussian
- **Σ (covariance)**: Shape of each Gaussian (can be elliptical)
- **π (mixing coefficient)**: Weight of each Gaussian

### Training: EM Algorithm
1. **E-step**: Calculate probability each point belongs to each Gaussian
2. **M-step**: Update parameters based on weighted average

### GMM vs K-means

| GMM | K-means |
|-----|---------|
| Soft assignment | Hard assignment |
| Elliptical clusters | Spherical clusters |
| More flexible | Less flexible |

---

## Question 18: How can you determine the optimal number of clusters for a dataset?

### Three Main Methods

**1. Elbow Method**
- Plot WCSS vs K (K = 1, 2, 3...)
- Find "elbow" where decrease slows
- Limitation: Elbow can be ambiguous

**2. Silhouette Score**
- Plot silhouette score vs K
- Choose K with **highest** score
- More reliable than Elbow

**3. Gap Statistic**
- Compare observed WCSS to null reference
- Choose K maximizing the "gap"
- More rigorous, but complex

### Best Practice
Combine methods: Use Elbow for range, Silhouette to pick best K. Also consider domain knowledge (how many segments can marketing handle?).

---

## Question 19: Explain the concept of cluster validity indices.

### Definition
Metrics to evaluate clustering quality, used to:
1. Compare different algorithms
2. Determine optimal K

### Internal Indices (No ground truth)

| Index | Measures | Better Score |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Silhouette** | Cohesion vs separation | Higher (max 1) |
| **Davies-Bouldin** | Cluster similarity | Lower |
| **Calinski-Harabasz** | Between/within variance ratio | Higher |

### External Indices (With ground truth)

| Index | Measures | Better Score |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Adjusted Rand Index** | Agreement corrected for chance | 1.0 = perfect |
| **Normalized Mutual Information** | Mutual information normalized | 1.0 = perfect |
| **V-measure** | Harmonic mean of homogeneity & completeness | 1.0 = perfect |

---

## Question 20: What challenges do you face when clustering high-dimensional data?

### The Curse of Dimensionality

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Meaningless Distances** | All points become roughly equidistant |
| **Data Sparsity** | Points spread out, hard to find dense regions |
| **Irrelevant Features** | Noise masks true cluster structure |
| **Computational Cost** | Time/memory increase exponentially |

### Solutions

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - PCA before clustering
   - Autoencoders for non-linear compression

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Remove low-variance features
   - Use domain knowledge

3. **Specialized Algorithms**
   - Subspace clustering (CLIQUE)
   - Algorithms designed for high-D data

---

## Question 21: What are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and how do they work?

### Definition
GANs are generative models with two competing neural networks learning to generate realistic synthetic data.

### Components

| Network | Role | Goal |
|---------|------|------|
| **Generator (G)** | "Counterfeiter" | Create fake data that fools D |
| **Discriminator (D)** | "Detective" | Distinguish real from fake |

### Training Process

1. **Train D**: Show real samples (label=1), fake samples from G (label=0)
2. **Train G**: Generate fakes, try to make D output 1 (fooled)
3. **Repeat**: D gets better at detecting, G gets better at fooling

### Equilibrium
- G produces perfectly realistic samples
- D can't do better than random guessing (50/50)

### Why Unsupervised
Learns data distribution without labels to generate new samples.

---

## Question 22: Explain the concept of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

### Difference from Standard Autoencoder
- **Autoencoder**: Maps input to single point in latent space
- **VAE**: Maps input to parameters of a distribution (μ, σ)

### Architecture

1. **Encoder**: Input → (μ, σ) parameters
2. **Sampling**: Sample z from N(μ, σ) using reparameterization trick
3. **Decoder**: z → Reconstructed output

### Loss Function
1. **Reconstruction Loss**: How well decoder reconstructs input
2. **KL Divergence**: Regularizes latent distribution toward N(0, 1)

### Generation
1. Sample random z from N(0, 1)
2. Pass through decoder → New, plausible data sample

### Why KL Term?
Forces continuous, well-structured latent space essential for generation.

## Question 23: How do unsupervised learning techniques contribute to the field of natural language processing (NLP)?

### Key Contributions

**1. Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**
- Learn vector representations from context
- Capture semantic relationships: king - man + woman ≈ queen

**2. Topic Modeling (LDA)**
- Discover topics in document collections
- Each document = mixture of topics

**3. Pre-trained Language Models (BERT, GPT)**

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Masked LM (BERT)** | Predict masked words from context |
| **Causal LM (GPT)** | Predict next word |

**Impact**: 
- Train on massive unlabeled text
- Fine-tune on small labeled data
- State-of-the-art on all NLP tasks

This is the **foundation of modern NLP** - unsupervised pre-training revolutionized the field.

---

## Question 24: Describe the role of unsupervised pre-training in deep learning.

### Definition
Train model on large unlabeled data first, then fine-tune on smaller labeled data.

### Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Leverage Unlabeled Data** | Abundant and cheap |
| **Better Performance** | Rich feature representations |
| **Faster Convergence** | Good starting weights |
| **Regularization** | Pre-trained features prevent overfitting |

### Pre-training Tasks

- Causal LM: Predict next word

**Vision (SimCLR, DINO)**:
- Contrastive Learning: Similar augmentations close, different images far
- Image Inpainting: Predict missing patches

### Workflow
```
Large Unlabeled Data → Pre-train → Fine-tune on Small Labeled Data → Deploy
```

This is now the **default approach** in modern deep learning for NLP and vision.

---

## Question 25: Discuss the use of self-organizing maps in unsupervised learning.

### Definition
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a neural network that projects high-dimensional data onto a 2D grid while preserving topological relationships.

### Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Receives high-D vectors
- **Output Layer**: 2D grid of neurons, each with weight vector same dimension as input

### Training (Competitive Learning)

1. **Competition**: For each input, find Best Matching Unit (BMU) - neuron with most similar weights
2. **Cooperation**: Update BMU and its neighbors on the grid
3. **Adaptation**: Move weights closer to input; neighbors move less

### Result
- Neurons close on map have similar weight vectors
- Preserves topology: similar inputs activate nearby neurons

### Use Cases

| Application | How |
|-------------|-----|
| **Visualization** | Project high-D data to 2D map |
| **Clustering** | Neurons form natural clusters |
| **Feature Extraction** | BMU position as new feature |

### Comparison to t-SNE
- SOM: Discrete grid, faster, good for large data
- t-SNE: Continuous space, better local structure preservation

---

## Question 26: What are some of the latest advancements in clustering algorithms?

### Answer

Clustering has evolved significantly beyond traditional K-means and hierarchical methods.

**Modern Advancements:**

| Advancement | Description | Key Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Deep Clustering** | Neural networks (autoencoders) learn representations optimized for clustering | Handles complex, non-linear structures |

| **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)** | Probabilistic soft clustering | Provides cluster membership probabilities |
| **Self-Supervised Clustering** | Combines contrastive learning with clustering (e.g., SCAN, SwAV) | State-of-the-art on image clustering |

**Deep Clustering Methods:**
```
Input Data → Encoder Network → Latent Space → Clustering Loss + Reconstruction Loss
                                    ↓
                             Cluster Assignments
```

- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** for external validation
- **Stability-based** methods: Cluster solutions across bootstrap samples to assess robustness

---

## Question 27: How has unsupervised learning been used in the field of reinforcement learning?

### Two Major Applications

**1. Representation Learning**
- **Problem**: High-dimensional states (e.g., raw pixels)
- **Solution**: Use autoencoders or contrastive learning to compress state space
- **Result**: RL agent learns policy on simpler representation

**Example**: CURL (Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for RL)

**2. Intrinsic Motivation for Exploration**
- **Problem**: Sparse rewards → agent never finds signal
- **Solution**: Create "curiosity" reward from unsupervised learning

**Methods**:
- **Prediction Error**: Reward for surprising (hard-to-predict) states
- **State Novelty**: Reward for visiting low-density regions
- **Skill Discovery**: Learn diverse skills unsupervised

### Impact
Makes RL more scalable and sample-efficient for complex environments.

---

## Question 28: Discuss the challenges of interpretability in unsupervised learning models.

### Core Challenge
No ground truth → No way to verify if discovered patterns are "correct"

### Specific Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cluster Labeling** | Clusters are just "0, 1, 2..." - no inherent meaning |
| **Ambiguity** | Different algorithms/parameters → different results |
| **Black-box Features** | PCA components, autoencoder latent space have no intuitive meaning |
| **Validation Difficulty** | High silhouette ≠ business value |

### Strategies to Improve Interpretability

**1. Start Simple**
- Use K-means before GMM
- Centroid-based clusters easier to explain

**2. Feature Importance for Clusters**
```python
# Train decision tree to predict cluster labels
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
dt.fit(X, cluster_labels)
# Inspect feature importances and rules
```

**3. Extensive Visualization**
- Box plots of features per cluster
- Parallel coordinate plots
- t-SNE/UMAP colored by cluster

**4. Domain Expert Validation**
- Have experts review cluster characteristics
- Ask: "Do these segments make business sense?"

**5. Cluster Profiling Report**
```python
# For each cluster, show:
# - Size (% of data)
# - Mean/median of key features
# - Distinguishing characteristics vs other clusters
```

### Key Takeaway
Interpretability requires **human-in-the-loop** analysis. Quantitative metrics are necessary but not sufficient - domain knowledge is essential for validation.

---

## Question 29: How can you use unsupervised learning for cross-lingual or multilingual text analysis?

### Core Approach: Multilingual Embeddings
Create shared vector space where words/sentences from different languages with similar meanings are close together.

### Methods

**1. Multilingual Word Embeddings**
- Train separate embeddings per language

- "cat" (English) ≈ "gato" (Spanish) ≈ "chat" (French)

**2. Multilingual Transformers (State-of-the-Art)**
- **mBERT**, **XLM-R**: Pre-trained on 100+ languages
- Self-supervised (Masked LM) on combined multilingual corpus
- Automatically learns shared representation space

### Key Application: Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer

1. Fine-tune mBERT on English sentiment data
2. Model works on German, Spanish, French sentiment
3. **No labeled data needed in target languages**

### Other Applications
- Cross-lingual information retrieval
- Machine translation
- Multilingual document clustering

---

## Question 30: What is the role of unsupervised learning in Big Data analytics?

### Answer

Unsupervised learning is essential in Big Data because most real-world data is **unlabeled** — labeling is expensive, slow, and often infeasible at scale.

**Key Roles:**

| Role | Technique | Big Data Application |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Data Exploration** | PCA, t-SNE, UMAP | Understand structure of massive datasets before modeling |
| **Customer Segmentation** | K-means, DBSCAN | Segment millions of users by behavior patterns |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Isolation Forest, Autoencoders | Detect fraud, network intrusions, system failures |
| **Topic Discovery** | LDA, NMF | Extract themes from millions of documents |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Matrix Factorization, Collaborative Filtering | Discover user-item latent factors |
| **Data Compression** | PCA, Autoencoders | Reduce storage/bandwidth for large datasets |

**Why Unsupervised Learning for Big Data?**

| Challenge | How Unsupervised Helps |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Volume** | Processes data without requiring manual labels |
| **Variety** | Discovers patterns across heterogeneous data types |
| **Velocity** | Online clustering algorithms handle streaming data |
| **Veracity** | Anomaly detection identifies noise/errors |
| **Value** | Extracts actionable insights from raw data |

**Scalable Implementations:**
```
Apache Spark MLlib  → Distributed K-means, PCA, LDA
Google BigQuery ML  → K-means clustering on warehouse data
AWS SageMaker       → Built-in algorithms for large-scale clustering
TensorFlow/PyTorch  → Deep learning-based unsupervised methods on GPUs
```

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Netflix**: Unsupervised clustering of viewing patterns → content recommendation
- **Uber**: Anomaly detection in ride pricing and driver behavior
- **Google**: Word2Vec (unsupervised) trained on billions of words → semantic understanding
- **Twitter/X**: Topic modeling on millions of tweets for trend detection
