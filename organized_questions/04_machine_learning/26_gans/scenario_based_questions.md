# GANs Interview Questions - Scenario-Based Questions

## Question 1: Discuss the architecture and benefits of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs)

### Definition
WGAN replaces the standard GAN loss with Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover's Distance), providing more stable training, meaningful loss values, and eliminating mode collapse through better gradient properties.

### Key Architectural Changes

| Standard GAN | WGAN |
|--------------|------|
| Discriminator outputs probability | Critic outputs unbounded score |
| Binary cross-entropy loss | Wasserstein distance |
| Sigmoid activation | No activation (linear) |
| No weight constraint | Weight clipping or gradient penalty |

### Wasserstein Distance (Earth Mover's Distance)
Intuition: Minimum "work" to transform one distribution into another.

$$W(p_r, p_g) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(p_r, p_g)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma}[||x - y||]$$

### WGAN Loss Functions

**Critic (replaces Discriminator):**
$$\mathcal{L}_C = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[C(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[C(G(z))]$$

**Generator:**
$$\mathcal{L}_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[C(G(z))]$$

### Lipschitz Constraint
WGAN requires Critic to be 1-Lipschitz:

| Method | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Weight Clipping (WGAN)** | Clip weights to [-c, c] after each update |
| **Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** | Add penalty on gradient norm |

**Gradient Penalty:**
$$\mathcal{L}_{GP} = \lambda \mathbb{E}_{\hat{x}}[(||\nabla_{\hat{x}} C(\hat{x})||_2 - 1)^2]$$

### Benefits Over Standard GAN

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Meaningful Loss** | Loss correlates with sample quality |
| **Stable Training** | No mode collapse, balancing D/G easier |
| **Better Gradients** | No vanishing gradients |
| **Training Signal** | Always provides useful gradient |

### Python Implementation
```python
def wgan_gp_loss(critic, real, fake, lambda_gp=10):
    # Critic loss
    c_real = critic(real).mean()
    c_fake = critic(fake).mean()
    c_loss = c_fake - c_real
    
    # Gradient penalty
    alpha = torch.rand(real.size(0), 1, 1, 1, device=device)
    interpolated = alpha * real + (1 - alpha) * fake
    interpolated.requires_grad_(True)
    c_interp = critic(interpolated)
    
    gradients = torch.autograd.grad(
        outputs=c_interp, inputs=interpolated,
        grad_outputs=torch.ones_like(c_interp),
        create_graph=True
    )[0]
    gp = ((gradients.norm(2, dim=1) - 1) ** 2).mean()
    
    return c_loss + lambda_gp * gp
```

---

## Question 2: Discuss Progressive Growing of GANs (PGGANs) and their unique training approach

### Definition
PGGAN trains GANs by progressively increasing image resolution, starting from low resolution and gradually adding layers. This stabilizes training and enables generation of high-resolution images (1024x1024+).

### Core Innovation
Instead of training full resolution from start:
```
4x4 → 8x8 → 16x16 → 32x32 → ... → 1024x1024
```

### Training Process

| Phase | Resolution | What Happens |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Initial | 4x4 | Train basic structure |
| Transition | 4x4 → 8x8 | Blend new layers in |
| Stabilization | 8x8 | Train at new resolution |
| Repeat | ... | Continue to target resolution |

### Smooth Transition (Fading)
New layers are blended in using parameter α (0→1):
$$output = (1 - \alpha) \cdot upsample(low\_res) + \alpha \cdot new\_layer(low\_res)$$

### Architecture Details

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| **Generator** | Start small, add conv layers progressively |
| **Discriminator** | Mirror structure, grow together |
| **Normalization** | Pixel-wise normalization |
| **Equalized LR** | Scale weights by layer-specific constant |

### Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stability** | Learns coarse structure first |
| **Quality** | High-resolution details emerge naturally |
| **Training Speed** | Early stages are faster |
| **Memory Efficient** | Only current resolution in memory |

### Visual Representation
```
Stage 1:    [G: 4x4]  ←→  [D: 4x4]
Stage 2:    [G: 4x4 → 8x8]  ←→  [D: 8x8 → 4x4]
Stage 3:    [G: 4x4 → 8x8 → 16x16]  ←→  [D: 16x16 → 8x8 → 4x4]
...
Final:      [G: full resolution]  ←→  [D: full resolution]
```

### Code Structure
```python
class ProgressiveGenerator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList()
        self.to_rgb = nn.ModuleList()
        
    def forward(self, z, current_stage, alpha):
        x = self.initial_block(z)
        
        for i in range(current_stage):
            x = self.blocks[i](x)
        
        # Blending during transition
        if alpha < 1 and current_stage > 0:
            x_low = F.interpolate(self.to_rgb[current_stage-1](x_prev), scale_factor=2)
            x_high = self.to_rgb[current_stage](x)
            return (1 - alpha) * x_low + alpha * x_high
        
        return self.to_rgb[current_stage](x)
```

## Question 3: How would you preprocess data for training GANs?

### Definition
GAN data preprocessing prepares images for optimal training by normalizing pixel values, resizing to target dimensions, and optionally augmenting to improve model robustness and generalization.

### Preprocessing Pipeline

| Step | Purpose | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Resize** | Match target resolution | Bilinear/bicubic interpolation |
| **Center Crop** | Remove borders, focus on subject | Crop to square |
| **Normalize** | Scale to expected range | [-1, 1] for Tanh output |
| **Convert** | Proper format | RGB, float32 |

### Normalization Strategies

| Range | When to Use | Generator Output |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **[-1, 1]** | Most GANs (Tanh) | nn.Tanh() |
| **[0, 1]** | Some architectures | nn.Sigmoid() |

**Formula for [-1, 1]:**
$$x_{norm} = \frac{x - 127.5}{127.5} = \frac{x}{127.5} - 1$$

### Python Implementation
```python
from torchvision import transforms

# Standard GAN preprocessing
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(64),           # Resize to target
    transforms.CenterCrop(64),       # Square crop
    transforms.ToTensor(),           # [0, 1]
    transforms.Normalize(            # [-1, 1]
        mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
        std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
    )
])

# Inverse transform for visualization
def denormalize(tensor):
    return tensor * 0.5 + 0.5  # Back to [0, 1]
```

### Data Augmentation Considerations

| Augmentation | Use in GANs? | Reason |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Horizontal Flip** | Yes (usually) | Increases diversity |
| **Color Jitter** | Careful | May confuse generator |
| **Rotation** | Domain-dependent | Faces: no, objects: maybe |
| **DiffAugment** | Yes | Stabilizes small datasets |

### Dataset Loading
```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder

dataset = ImageFolder(root='data/images', transform=transform)
dataloader = DataLoader(
    dataset, 
    batch_size=64, 
    shuffle=True,
    num_workers=4,
    drop_last=True  # Important: keep batch size consistent
)
```

### Best Practices
- Keep aspect ratio when possible
- Use high-quality source images
- Filter out corrupted/bad samples
- Match preprocessing for training and inference

## Question 4: How would you address issues of overfitting in GANs?

### Definition
GAN overfitting occurs when the Discriminator memorizes training samples or the Generator produces copies of training data. Addressing it requires regularization, augmentation, and architectural choices.

### Signs of Overfitting

| Symptom | Indicates |
|---------|-----------|
| D accuracy = 100% | D memorized training data |
| Generated = Training samples | G memorized, not generalized |
| FID improves then worsens | Overfitting point reached |
| Low diversity in outputs | Mode collapse variant |

### Solutions

| Technique | How It Helps |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Data Augmentation** | Increase effective dataset size |
| **Regularization** | Constrain network capacity |
| **Early Stopping** | Stop before overfitting |
| **Reduce Capacity** | Smaller networks generalize better |
| **Dropout** | Prevent co-adaptation |

### Differentiable Augmentation
Apply same augmentation to real and fake:
```python
def train_step(real, z):
    fake = generator(z)
    
    # Augment both consistently
    real_aug = augment(real)
    fake_aug = augment(fake)
    
    # D sees augmented versions
    d_real = discriminator(real_aug)
    d_fake = discriminator(fake_aug)
```

### Regularization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Spectral Norm** | `spectral_norm(layer)` |
| **Gradient Penalty** | WGAN-GP loss term |
| **R1 Regularization** | Penalize D gradients on real |
| **Dropout** | `nn.Dropout(0.3)` in D |

### R1 Regularization
```python
def r1_penalty(discriminator, real_images):
    real_images.requires_grad_(True)
    d_out = discriminator(real_images)
    gradients = torch.autograd.grad(
        outputs=d_out.sum(), inputs=real_images,
        create_graph=True
    )[0]
    r1 = gradients.pow(2).view(gradients.size(0), -1).sum(1).mean()
    return r1
```

### Monitoring for Overfitting
```python
# Track these metrics during training
def monitor_overfitting(real_batch, generator, fid_calculator):
    # Generate samples
    fake = generator(torch.randn(len(real_batch), latent_dim))
    
    # Check nearest neighbor distance
    nn_dist = nearest_neighbor_distance(fake, real_batch)
    if nn_dist < threshold:
        print("Warning: Generated samples too close to training")
    
    # Periodic FID on validation set
    fid = fid_calculator.calculate(fake, val_set)
    return fid, nn_dist
```

## Question 5: Discuss strategies for selecting optimal number of layers and neurons for Generator and Discriminator

### Definition
Selecting GAN architecture involves balancing capacity (ability to learn complex patterns) against overfitting risk, while maintaining balance between Generator and Discriminator capabilities.

### General Guidelines

| Factor | Generator | Discriminator |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Capacity** | Sufficient for complexity | Slightly more than G |
| **Depth** | Deeper for complex data | Mirror G structure |
| **Width** | 64-512 filters typical | Similar to G |
| **Balance** | Neither should dominate | Match capabilities |

### Capacity Selection Based on Data

| Data Complexity | Example | Architecture |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| **Simple** | MNIST | 2-3 conv layers, 32-64 filters |
| **Medium** | CIFAR-10 | 4-5 conv layers, 64-128 filters |
| **Complex** | CelebA-HQ | 6+ layers, 256-512 filters |

### Architecture Design Strategy

**Step 1: Start with DCGAN baseline**
```python
# Generator
G: [z:100] → FC → [4x4x512] → Conv↑ → [8x8x256] → ... → [64x64x3]

# Discriminator  
D: [64x64x3] → Conv↓ → [32x32x64] → Conv↓ → ... → FC → [1]
```

**Step 2: Scale based on resolution**
```
Resolution    Typical Depth
64x64         4-5 layers
128x128       5-6 layers
256x256       6-7 layers
512x512+      Progressive or StyleGAN
```

### Filter Progression
```python
# Common patterns
# Generator: increase then decrease filters
G_filters = [512, 256, 128, 64, 3]  # 4x4 to 64x64

# Discriminator: opposite pattern
D_filters = [64, 128, 256, 512, 1]  # 64x64 to 4x4
```

### Balancing D and G

| Imbalance | Symptom | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| **D too strong** | G loss stuck high | Reduce D capacity, train G more |
| **G too strong** | D loss = 0.5 always | Increase D capacity |

### Hyperparameter Search
```python
# Architecture search space
architectures = {
    'small': {'g_filters': [256, 128, 64], 'd_filters': [64, 128, 256]},
    'medium': {'g_filters': [512, 256, 128, 64], 'd_filters': [64, 128, 256, 512]},
    'large': {'g_filters': [1024, 512, 256, 128, 64], ...}
}

# Train each, select by FID
best_fid = float('inf')
for name, arch in architectures.items():
    model = build_gan(arch)
    fid = train_and_evaluate(model)
    if fid < best_fid:
        best_arch = name
```

### Best Practices
- Start with proven architecture (DCGAN, StyleGAN)
- Scale depth with resolution
- Keep G and D balanced in capacity
- Use spectral normalization for stability regardless of size

## Question 6: How would you use GANs to improve the realism of synthetic data in a simulation?

### Scenario
A company uses simulation for testing autonomous vehicles but simulated images look artificial. GANs can improve realism for better sim-to-real transfer.

### Solution: Sim-to-Real Domain Adaptation

**Approach**: Use CycleGAN or similar to translate simulated images to realistic domain

```
Simulated Image → GAN → Realistic-looking Image
                          (same content, realistic style)
```

### Architecture Choice

| Method | When to Use | Pros/Cons |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **CycleGAN** | Unpaired data | Flexible, may hallucinate |
| **Pix2Pix** | Paired data | More accurate, needs pairs |
| **UNIT** | Shared latent space | Good for similar domains |

### Implementation Pipeline
```python
# Train sim-to-real translator
class SimToRealGAN:
    def __init__(self):
        self.G_sim2real = Generator()  # Sim → Real
        self.G_real2sim = Generator()  # Real → Sim (for cycle)
        self.D_real = Discriminator()
        self.D_sim = Discriminator()
    
    def train_step(self, sim_images, real_images):
        # Translate sim to real
        fake_real = self.G_sim2real(sim_images)
        
        # Cycle back
        reconstructed_sim = self.G_real2sim(fake_real)
        
        # Losses
        adv_loss = adversarial_loss(self.D_real, real_images, fake_real)
        cycle_loss = L1_loss(sim_images, reconstructed_sim)
        
        return adv_loss + lambda_cyc * cycle_loss
```

### Preserving Content

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Cycle Consistency** | Ensure content preserved |
| **Identity Loss** | Real images unchanged |
| **Perceptual Loss** | Semantic content maintained |

### Validation
1. Visual inspection of realism
2. Downstream task performance (detection on enhanced images)
3. FID between enhanced sim and real

### Practical Considerations
- Train on diverse simulation scenarios
- Include edge cases and rare events
- Validate that safety-critical features preserved
- Don't hide simulation artifacts that indicate errors

## Question 7: Propose a GAN architecture for generating photorealistic textures in a game development context

### Scenario
Game studio needs to generate varied, seamless textures (stone, wood, fabric) for environments without manual artist work for each variation.

### Architecture: Texture-GAN

**Requirements:**
- Seamless tiling
- Controllable variation
- High resolution (512x512+)
- Style/material control

### Proposed Architecture

**Generator:**
```
Style Vector (material type) ─┐
                              ├─→ Mapping Network → Style Codes
Noise z ─────────────────────┘
                              ↓
Constant 4x4 → Style Inject → Upsample → ... → 512x512 Texture
```

**Key Components:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Conditional Input** | Material class (stone, wood, metal) |
| **Style Injection** | Control texture properties |
| **Periodic Padding** | Ensure seamless tiling |
| **Multi-scale D** | Quality at all frequencies |

### Seamless Tiling Approach
```python
class SeamlessGenerator(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, z, style):
        # Generate larger than needed
        texture = self.base_generator(z, style)
        
        # Circular/periodic padding for seamlessness
        texture = self.make_tileable(texture)
        return texture
    
    def make_tileable(self, x, blend_width=32):
        # Blend edges for seamless tiling
        left = x[:, :, :, :blend_width]
        right = x[:, :, :, -blend_width:]
        top = x[:, :, :blend_width, :]
        bottom = x[:, :, -blend_width:, :]
        
        # Smooth blending
        weights = torch.linspace(0, 1, blend_width)
        x[:, :, :, :blend_width] = left * (1-weights) + right * weights
        x[:, :, :blend_width, :] = top * (1-weights.view(-1,1)) + bottom * weights.view(-1,1)
        return x
```

### Training Data
- Collect real texture photographs
- Label by material type
- Ensure variety within each class
- Include normal maps if generating PBR materials

### Conditional Generation
```python
# Generate specific material
material_embedding = embed_material('rough_stone')
z = torch.randn(1, latent_dim)
texture = generator(z, material_embedding)

# Interpolate between materials
style_stone = embed_material('stone')
style_wood = embed_material('wood')
for alpha in [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]:
    mixed_style = alpha * style_stone + (1-alpha) * style_wood
    hybrid_texture = generator(z, mixed_style)
```

### Output Formats
- Diffuse/Albedo texture
- Normal map (optional second generator)
- Roughness/Metallic (for PBR)

## Question 8: Discuss how you would leverage GANs to enhance low-resolution medical images

### Scenario
Hospital has legacy low-resolution X-rays/CT scans that need enhancement for modern AI diagnostic systems without losing clinically important details.

### Approach: Medical Image Super-Resolution GAN

**Critical Requirement:** Must not hallucinate false medical features

### Architecture: Modified SRGAN for Medical

| Component | Modification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Generator** | ResNet-based, preserve fine details |
| **Discriminator** | Medical-domain trained |
| **Loss** | Emphasize diagnostic regions |
| **Validation** | Clinical expert review |

### Loss Function Design
```python
def medical_sr_loss(lr_image, hr_image, generated):
    # Pixel loss - basic reconstruction
    l1_loss = F.l1_loss(generated, hr_image)
    
    # Perceptual loss - VGG features (pre-trained on medical if available)
    perceptual_loss = vgg_loss(generated, hr_image)
    
    # Adversarial loss - realism
    adv_loss = adversarial_loss(discriminator(generated))
    
    # Gradient loss - preserve edges (important for medical)
    gradient_loss = gradient_difference_loss(generated, hr_image)
    
    # Clinical region emphasis (if annotated)
    roi_loss = F.mse_loss(
        generated * roi_mask, 
        hr_image * roi_mask
    ) if roi_mask is not None else 0
    
    return l1_loss + 0.1 * perceptual_loss + 0.001 * adv_loss + gradient_loss + roi_loss
```

### Safety Considerations

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Hallucination** | Heavy pixel loss weight |
| **False Features** | Expert validation |
| **Missing Details** | Conservative enhancement |
| **Regulatory** | Document as enhancement, not diagnosis |

### Training Pipeline
```
1. Collect paired low-res/high-res medical images
2. If unpaired: use degradation model to create pairs
3. Train with heavy reconstruction loss
4. Validate: 
   - Radiologist review
   - Downstream task (detection, segmentation)
   - Quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR)
```

### Validation Protocol
```python
def validate_medical_sr(model, test_set, radiologist_annotations):
    for lr, hr, annotations in test_set:
        enhanced = model(lr)
        
        # Quantitative
        psnr = calculate_psnr(enhanced, hr)
        ssim = calculate_ssim(enhanced, hr)
        
        # Clinical validation
        diagnostic_preserved = check_diagnostic_features(
            enhanced, annotations
        )
        
        # False positive check
        hallucinated_features = detect_hallucinations(
            enhanced, hr, threshold=0.01
        )
        
        if hallucinated_features:
            flag_for_review(enhanced)
```

### Best Practices
- Always keep original for comparison
- Use as assistive tool, not replacement
- Regular validation with medical experts
- Clear labeling that image was enhanced

## Question 9: How would you detect overfitting in a GAN model that generates music?

### Scenario
GAN trained to generate music seems to produce same melodies repeatedly. Need to detect and address potential overfitting or mode collapse.

### Detection Methods

| Method | What It Detects | Implementation |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Diversity Metrics** | Mode collapse | Compare generated samples |
| **Nearest Neighbor** | Memorization | Distance to training set |
| **Interpolation** | Smooth latent space | Generate between points |
| **Held-out Test** | Generalization | Likelihood on new data |

### Diversity Detection
```python
def detect_music_mode_collapse(generator, num_samples=100):
    samples = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        z = torch.randn(1, latent_dim)
        music = generator(z)  # e.g., MIDI or spectrogram
        samples.append(music)
    
    # Pairwise similarity
    similarities = []
    for i in range(len(samples)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(samples)):
            sim = compute_similarity(samples[i], samples[j])
            similarities.append(sim)
    
    avg_similarity = np.mean(similarities)
    
    # High similarity = mode collapse
    if avg_similarity > threshold:
        print(f"Warning: Mode collapse detected. Avg similarity: {avg_similarity}")
    
    return avg_similarity
```

### Music-Specific Similarity Metrics

| Metric | Measures |
|--------|----------|
| **Melodic Similarity** | Note sequences |
| **Rhythmic Similarity** | Beat patterns |
| **Harmonic Similarity** | Chord progressions |
| **Spectral Similarity** | Audio frequency content |

### Nearest Neighbor Test for Memorization
```python
def check_memorization(generated_music, training_set, threshold=0.95):
    for gen in generated_music:
        for train in training_set:
            similarity = music_similarity(gen, train)
            if similarity > threshold:
                print(f"Potential memorization: {similarity} similar to training")
                return True
    return False
```

### Interpolation Quality Test
```python
def test_interpolation_smoothness(generator):
    z1, z2 = torch.randn(2, latent_dim)
    
    interpolated_music = []
    for alpha in np.linspace(0, 1, 10):
        z_interp = alpha * z1 + (1 - alpha) * z2
        music = generator(z_interp)
        interpolated_music.append(music)
    
    # Check for smooth transitions
    for i in range(len(interpolated_music) - 1):
        diff = music_distance(interpolated_music[i], interpolated_music[i+1])
        if diff > smooth_threshold:
            print(f"Non-smooth interpolation at step {i}")
```

### Monitoring During Training
```python
# Track these metrics each epoch
metrics = {
    'diversity': compute_diversity(generator),
    'nearest_neighbor_dist': min_distance_to_training(generator, train_set),
    'unique_patterns': count_unique_patterns(generator, n=1000),
    'interpolation_smoothness': test_interpolation(generator)
}

# Alert if overfitting signs
if metrics['diversity'] < prev_diversity * 0.9:
    print("Diversity dropping - potential mode collapse")
if metrics['nearest_neighbor_dist'] < threshold:
    print("Generated too similar to training - potential memorization")
```

## Question 10: Discuss recent advances in GAN architectures and their training techniques

### Definition
Recent GAN advances focus on improved stability, higher resolution, better controllability, and efficiency. Key developments include StyleGAN series, BigGAN, and training innovations like adaptive augmentation.

### Major Architectural Advances

| Architecture | Year | Key Innovation |
|--------------|------|----------------|

### Training Technique Advances

| Technique | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **ADA** | Adaptive augmentation | Works with small datasets |
| **Projected GAN** | Feature projection | Faster convergence |
| **R1 Regularization** | Gradient penalty on real | Stability |
| **Mixed Precision** | FP16 training | 2x faster |

### Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (ADA)
```python
# Automatically adjust augmentation strength
def ada_step(discriminator, real, fake, target_rt=0.6):
    # rt = discriminator's output sign on real
    rt = torch.sign(discriminator(real)).mean()
    
    # Adjust augmentation probability
    if rt > target_rt:
        aug_prob += adjustment
    else:
        aug_prob -= adjustment
    
    return aug_prob
```
