## Sample Space & Events

### 1. What is this concept?
**Sample Space (Ω)**: The complete set of all possible outcomes in an experiment or data generation process. Think of it as the "universe" of everything that could happen.

**Event**: Any subset of the sample space - essentially any collection of outcomes we're interested in.

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Data Problem**: We need a mathematical framework to handle uncertainty in data
- **ML Context**: Every dataset represents samples from some underlying sample space
- **Decision Making**: ML models make predictions about unseen data points from the same sample space

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?
- **Data Collection**: Defining what constitutes valid data points
- **Train/Test Split**: Each split represents a subset (event) of the total sample space
- **Feature Engineering**: Each feature value comes from its own sample space
- **Model Evaluation**: Confusion matrices partition the prediction space into events
- **A/B Testing**: Treatment and control groups are events in the experiment space

### 4. Full Formula:
```
Sample Space: Ω = {ω₁, ω₂, ω₃, ...}
Event: A ⊆ Ω

Requirements:
- Mutually Exclusive: ωᵢ ∩ ωⱼ = ∅ for i ≠ j
- Collectively Exhaustive: ⋃ᵢ ωᵢ = Ω  
- Right Granularity: Choose appropriate level of detail
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **ω (omega)**: Individual outcome/data point
- **Ω (capital omega)**: Complete sample space
- **A**: An event (subset of outcomes we care about)
- **⊆**: "Subset of" symbol

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**Ω**mega contains **A**ll possible outcomes, **A**ny event is **A** piece of **Ω**mega"
- **Ω** looks like a bucket containing everything
- **A** is just scooping some items from the bucket

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Data Leakage**: Including future data in training (violating temporal sample space)
- **Distribution Shift**: Train/test from different sample spaces
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Test set doesn't represent the full sample space
- **Wrong Granularity**: Defining sample space too broadly (overfitting) or too narrowly (underfitting)

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample Space: All possible email data points
emails = ["spam_email_1", "ham_email_2", "spam_email_3", ...]

# Events: Different subsets of the sample space
spam_event = [email for email in emails if "spam" in email]
ham_event = [email for email in emails if "ham" in email]

# Train/Test as events
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
# X_train and X_test are events in the feature space
# y_train and y_test are events in the label space
```

### 8. Real-life ML/DS Examples:
- **Netflix**: Sample space = all possible user-movie interactions
- **Tesla Autopilot**: Sample space = all possible driving scenarios
- **Google Translate**: Sample space = all possible sentence pairs across languages
- **Credit Scoring**: Sample space = all possible loan applicant profiles

### 9. ML Models and Loss Functions Connection:
- **Classification**: Each class is an event in the label space
- **Regression**: Prediction intervals define events in the continuous output space
- **Generative Models**: Learn to sample from the true data sample space

### 10. Related Interview Questions:
- "How do you ensure your test set represents the same sample space as production data?"
- "What's the difference between i.i.d. assumption and sample space definition?"
- "How would you handle distribution shift between train and test data?"

## Probability Axioms

### 1. What is this concept?
The three fundamental rules that any valid probability measure must follow. Think of them as the "laws of physics" for probability.

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Consistency**: Ensures probability assignments make mathematical sense
- **ML Foundation**: All ML algorithms implicitly rely on these axioms
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides principled way to handle uncertainty

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?
- **Model Confidence**: Softmax outputs must sum to 1 (normalization axiom)
- **Ensemble Methods**: Weighted averaging requires probability axioms
- **Bayesian ML**: Prior and posterior distributions must satisfy axioms
- **Loss Functions**: Cross-entropy loss derives from these axioms

### 4. Full Formula:
```
Axiom 1 (Non-negativity): P(A) ≥ 0 for all events A
Axiom 2 (Normalization): P(Ω) = 1  
Axiom 3 (Additivity): For disjoint events A₁, A₂, ...:
                       P(⋃ᵢ Aᵢ) = Σᵢ P(Aᵢ)
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **P(A)**: Probability of event A (always between 0 and 1)
- **P(Ω) = 1**: Total probability of all outcomes is 1
- **Disjoint**: Events that cannot happen simultaneously (A ∩ B = ∅)
- **⋃**: Union (OR operation)
- **Σ**: Sum over all events

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**N**ever **N**egative, **A**lways **O**ne, **A**dd **D**isjoint"
1. **Never Negative**: Probabilities can't be negative (makes intuitive sense)
2. **Always One**: Something must happen (certainty)
3. **Add Disjoint**: If events can't happen together, add their probabilities

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Invalid Probabilities**: Neural network outputs < 0 or > 1
- **Non-normalized Outputs**: Softmax probabilities don't sum to 1
- **Double Counting**: Adding probabilities of overlapping events
- **Bayesian Errors**: Improper priors that don't integrate to 1

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Axiom 1: Non-negativity (Softmax ensures this)
logits = torch.tensor([2.0, 1.0, 3.0])
probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=0)
print(f"All non-negative: {(probabilities >= 0).all()}")

# Axiom 2: Normalization (Softmax ensures this)  
print(f"Sum to 1: {probabilities.sum().item():.6f}")

# Axiom 3: Additivity (for disjoint events)
# If events A and B are disjoint: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)
p_class_0 = 0.3
p_class_1 = 0.5  
p_class_2 = 0.2
p_class_0_or_1 = p_class_0 + p_class_1  # Valid since classes are disjoint
print(f"P(class 0 or 1) = {p_class_0_or_1}")
```

### 8. Real-life ML/DS Examples:
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Disease probabilities must be non-negative and bounded
- **Recommendation Systems**: Item preference probabilities follow axioms
- **Natural Language Processing**: Word prediction probabilities in language models
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection confidence scores

### 9. ML Models and Loss Functions Connection:
- **Cross-entropy Loss**: Directly derived from probability axioms
- **KL Divergence**: Measures how one probability distribution differs from another
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Finds parameters that maximize probability of observed data

### 10. Related Interview Questions:
- "Why does cross-entropy loss work for classification?"
- "How do you ensure your model outputs valid probabilities?"
- "What's the relationship between softmax and probability axioms?"

## Conditional Probability & Bayes' Rule

### 1. What is this concept?
**Conditional Probability**: The probability of event A happening given that event B has already occurred.
**Bayes' Rule**: A way to "reverse" conditional probabilities - if you know P(B|A), you can find P(A|B).

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Information Updates**: How to update beliefs when new evidence arrives
- **Feature Dependencies**: Understanding how features relate to each other and targets
- **Causal Reasoning**: Distinguishing correlation from causation in ML models

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying features most informative about the target
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Directly uses conditional probabilities
- **Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization**: Updates parameter beliefs with each trial
- **Active Learning**: Selecting most informative samples to label
- **Anomaly Detection**: P(normal|features) vs P(anomaly|features)

### 4. Full Formula:
```
Conditional Probability:
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(B) > 0

Bayes' Rule:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

Total Probability Theorem:
P(B) = Σᵢ P(Aᵢ) × P(B|Aᵢ)  [for partition {A₁, A₂, ...}]

Complete Bayes' Rule:
P(Aᵢ|B) = [P(Aᵢ) × P(B|Aᵢ)] / [Σⱼ P(Aⱼ) × P(B|Aⱼ)]
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **P(A|B)**: "Probability of A given B"
- **P(A ∩ B)**: "Probability of both A and B"
- **P(A)**: Prior probability (before seeing evidence)
- **P(A|B)**: Posterior probability (after seeing evidence B)
- **P(B|A)**: Likelihood (how likely evidence B is given A)

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**P**osterior = **L**ikelihood × **P**rior / **E**vidence"
- **PLPE**: Posterior = Likelihood × Prior / Evidence
- Think of Bayes as "updating your belief with new evidence"
- Denominator P(B) is just normalization (like softmax)

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Base Rate Neglect**: Ignoring P(A) in classification (class imbalance)
- **Assuming Independence**: Naive Bayes assumes features are independent given class
- **Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A)**: Classic prosecutor's fallacy
- **Ignoring Prior**: Not incorporating domain knowledge into model priors

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Bayes' Rule in Email Spam Classification
# P(Spam|"Free Money") = P("Free Money"|Spam) × P(Spam) / P("Free Money")

# Prior probabilities
P_spam = 0.3  # 30% of emails are spam
P_ham = 0.7   # 70% of emails are ham

# Likelihoods  
P_free_money_given_spam = 0.8  # 80% of spam contains "free money"
P_free_money_given_ham = 0.05  # 5% of ham contains "free money"

# Evidence (total probability)
P_free_money = (P_free_money_given_spam * P_spam + 
                P_free_money_given_ham * P_ham)

# Posterior probability using Bayes' Rule
P_spam_given_free_money = (P_free_money_given_spam * P_spam) / P_free_money

print(f"P(Spam|'Free Money') = {P_spam_given_free_money:.3f}")

# Naive Bayes implementation
nb_classifier = GaussianNB()
nb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Internally uses Bayes' rule for classification
```

### 8. Real-life ML/DS Examples:
- **Medical Diagnosis**: P(Disease|Symptoms) using Bayes' rule
- **Fraud Detection**: P(Fraud|Transaction_Pattern)  
- **Recommendation Systems**: P(Like|User_Profile, Item_Features)
- **A/B Testing**: Updating conversion rate beliefs with new data
- **Search Engines**: P(Relevant|Query, Document)

### 9. ML Models and Loss Functions Connection:
- **Naive Bayes**: Directly implements Bayes' rule
- **Logistic Regression**: Models P(Y=1|X) directly
- **Bayesian Neural Networks**: Use Bayes' rule for weight uncertainty
- **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)**: Incorporates prior knowledge

### 10. Related Interview Questions:
- "Explain the difference between P(A|B) and P(B|A) with a real example"
- "How does class imbalance relate to Bayes' rule?"
- "When would you use a Bayesian approach vs. frequentist approach?"
- "How does Naive Bayes handle the curse of dimensionality?"

## Independence

### 1. What is this concept?
Two events are independent if knowing one occurred gives you no information about whether the other occurred. Mathematically, P(A∩B) = P(A)×P(B).

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Simplification**: Independent features allow simpler models and analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Helps identify which features provide unique information
- **Model Assumptions**: Many ML algorithms assume feature independence

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?
- **Feature Selection**: Remove redundant (dependent) features
- **Naive Bayes**: Assumes conditional independence of features given class
- **Principal Component Analysis**: Creates independent components
- **Ensemble Methods**: Independent base learners reduce overfitting
- **A/B Testing**: Ensures test groups are independent

### 4. Full Formula:
```
Independence:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

Equivalent conditions (when P(A), P(B) > 0):
P(A|B) = P(A)
P(B|A) = P(B)

Conditional Independence (given C):
P(A ∩ B|C) = P(A|C) × P(B|C)

Independence of multiple events A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ:
P(Aᵢ₁ ∩ Aᵢ₂ ∩ ... ∩ Aᵢₖ) = P(Aᵢ₁) × P(Aᵢ₂) × ... × P(Aᵢₖ)
for any subset {i₁, i₂, ..., iₖ}
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **∩**: Intersection (AND operation)
- **P(A|B) = P(A)**: Knowing B doesn't change probability of A
- **Conditional Independence**: A and B are independent when conditioned on C
- **Pairwise vs. Mutual Independence**: All pairs independent vs. entire collection independent

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**I**ndependent = **I**nformation × **I**nformation"
- If independent: P(A∩B) = P(A) × P(B) (multiply probabilities)
- If knowing B doesn't help predict A, then P(A|B) = P(A)
- Think: "Independent events don't gossip about each other"

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Naive Bayes Assumption**: Assuming features are independent when they're not
- **Feature Multicollinearity**: Highly correlated features violate independence
- **Data Leakage**: Features that are dependent on future information
- **Ensemble Overfitting**: Base models that are too similar (not independent)
- **Time Series**: Assuming sequential observations are independent

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif
import pandas as pd

# Test for independence using Chi-square test
def test_independence(feature1, feature2):
    contingency_table = pd.crosstab(feature1, feature2)
    chi2, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
    return p_value > 0.05  # Independent if p > 0.05

# Example: Testing if two features are independent
np.random.seed(42)
# Independent features
feature_A = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, 1000)
feature_B = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, 1000)

# Dependent features  
feature_C = feature_A * 0.8 + np.random.binomial(1, 0.2, 1000)

print(f"A and B independent: {test_independence(feature_A, feature_B)}")
print(f"A and C independent: {test_independence(feature_A, feature_C)}")

# Mutual Information (measures dependence)
target = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, 1000)
features = np.column_stack([feature_A, feature_B, feature_C])
mi_scores = mutual_info_classif(features, target)
print(f"Mutual Information scores: {mi_scores}")
```

### 8. Real-life ML/DS Examples:
- **Naive Bayes Email Spam**: Assumes word occurrences are independent given spam/ham
- **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Creates independent principal components
- **Random Forest**: Uses independent bootstrap samples and random feature subsets
- **A/B Testing**: Treatment assignment independent of user characteristics
- **Recommendation Systems**: User preferences assumed independent across items

### 9. ML Models and Loss Functions Connection:
- **Naive Bayes**: Core assumption of conditional independence
- **Linear Regression**: No multicollinearity assumption (features should be independent)
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**: Finds independent signal sources
- **Bayesian Networks**: Explicitly models dependencies and independencies

### 10. Related Interview Questions:
- "When is the independence assumption in Naive Bayes violated?"
- "How do you detect multicollinearity in linear regression?"
- "What's the difference between correlation and independence?"
- "How does feature independence affect model performance?"

## Counting & Combinatorics

### 1. What is this concept?
Mathematical techniques for counting arrangements, selections, and partitions. Essential for calculating probabilities in discrete spaces and understanding model complexity.

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Probability Calculation**: Many probability problems require counting favorable outcomes
- **Model Complexity**: Understanding the number of possible model configurations
- **Feature Engineering**: Counting possible feature combinations
- **Sampling Theory**: Determining sample sizes and sampling strategies

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?

- **Cross-Validation**: Understanding number of possible train/test splits
- **Feature Selection**: Computing number of possible feature subsets
- **Model Architecture**: Counting possible neural network configurations
- **Ensemble Methods**: Number of ways to combine base learners

### 4. Full Formula:
```
Basic Counting Principle:
Total choices = n₁ × n₂ × ... × nᵣ

Permutations (order matters):
P(n,k) = n!/(n-k)! = n × (n-1) × ... × (n-k+1)

Combinations (order doesn't matter):
C(n,k) = (n choose k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)

Multinomial Coefficient (partitions):
(n choose n₁,n₂,...,nᵣ) = n!/(n₁!n₂!...nᵣ!)

With Replacement:
- Permutations: nᵏ
- Combinations: C(n+k-1, k)
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **n!**: n factorial = n × (n-1) × ... × 2 × 1
- **P(n,k)**: Number of ways to arrange k items from n items
- **C(n,k)**: Number of ways to choose k items from n items
- **Multinomial**: Splitting n items into r groups of specific sizes

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**P**ermutations **P**ick order, **C**ombinations **C**are not"
- **Permutations**: "Position matters" → P(n,k) = n!/(n-k)!
- **Combinations**: "Count only" → C(n,k) = n!/[k!(n-k)!]
- Remember: Combinations always ≤ Permutations (since order doesn't matter)

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Hyperparameter Explosion**: Not realizing exponential growth in grid search
- **Feature Selection Complexity**: Underestimating 2ⁿ possible feature subsets
- **Cross-Validation Errors**: Wrong number of folds or combinations
- **Sampling Bias**: Not accounting for all possible samples
- **Model Comparison**: Incorrect multiple testing corrections

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import math
from itertools import combinations, permutations
from scipy.special import comb
import numpy as np

# Hyperparameter grid search complexity
learning_rates = [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
batch_sizes = [32, 64, 128]
hidden_units = [50, 100, 200]

total_combinations = len(learning_rates) * len(batch_sizes) * len(hidden_units)
print(f"Total hyperparameter combinations: {total_combinations}")

# Feature selection: choosing k features from n total
n_features = 20
k_selected = 5
feature_combinations = comb(n_features, k_selected, exact=True)
print(f"Ways to select {k_selected} from {n_features} features: {feature_combinations}")

# Cross-validation folds
n_samples = 1000
k_folds = 5
samples_per_fold = n_samples // k_folds
print(f"Samples per fold: {samples_per_fold}")

# Example: Probability calculation using counting
# Drawing 2 cards from deck without replacement
deck_size = 52
cards_drawn = 2
total_ways = comb(deck_size, cards_drawn)
favorable_ways = comb(13, 2)  # 2 hearts
probability = favorable_ways / total_ways
print(f"P(2 hearts) = {probability:.4f}")
```

Geometric: X ~ Geo(p)
P(X = k) = (1-p)^(k-1) × p

Poisson: X ~ Pois(λ)
P(X = k) = e^(-λ) × λ^k / k!

Discrete Uniform: X ~ DUnif(a,b)
P(X = k) = 1/(b-a+1) for k ∈ {a, a+1, ..., b}

- **Parameter Misinterpretation**: Confusing success probability with failure rate
- **Independence Violations**: Using binomial when trials aren't independent
- **Infinite Support Issues**: Not handling edge cases in geometric/Poisson
- **Label Encoding Errors**: Inappropriate numerical encoding of categories

### 7. Python Example:

# Bernoulli: Single trial (e.g., click/no-click)
p_click = 0.3
clicks = stats.bernoulli.rvs(p_click, size=1000)
print(f"Click rate: {clicks.mean():.3f}")

# Binomial: Multiple trials (e.g., clicks in 10 impressions)
n_impressions = 10
clicks_per_user = stats.binom.rvs(n_impressions, p_click, size=1000)
print(f"Average clicks per user: {clicks_per_user.mean():.3f}")

# Geometric: Time until first success (e.g., trials until conversion)
trials_until_conversion = stats.geom.rvs(p_click, size=1000)
print(f"Average trials until conversion: {trials_until_conversion.mean():.3f}")

# Poisson: Events in fixed time (e.g., server requests per minute)
lambda_requests = 5.0

## Probability Mass Functions

### 1. What is this concept?
The Probability Mass Function (PMF) specifies the probability that a discrete random variable equals specific values. It's the discrete analog of a probability density function.

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Complete Description**: Fully characterizes a discrete random variable
- **Prediction**: Enables probabilistic predictions for classification
- **Model Training**: Foundation for maximum likelihood estimation
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence in predictions

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?
- **Classification Models**: Softmax outputs are PMFs over class labels
- **Language Models**: PMF over next word in vocabulary
- **Recommendation Systems**: PMF over item preferences
- **Anomaly Detection**: PMF to identify low-probability events
- **Model Evaluation**: Computing likelihood of test data

### 4. Full Formula:
```
PMF Definition:
p_X(x) = P(X = x) = P({ω ∈ Ω : X(ω) = x})

Properties:
1. p_X(x) ≥ 0 for all x
2. Σ_x p_X(x) = 1

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):
F_X(x) = P(X ≤ x) = Σ_{k≤x} p_X(k)

Joint PMF (for multiple variables):
p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)

Marginal PMF:
p_X(x) = Σ_y p_{X,Y}(x,y)

Conditional PMF:
p_{X|Y}(x|y) = p_{X,Y}(x,y) / p_Y(y)
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **p_X(x)**: PMF of variable X at value x
- **F_X(x)**: CDF (cumulative probability up to x)
- **Joint PMF**: Probability of multiple variables taking specific values
- **Marginal PMF**: Probability of one variable ignoring others
- **Conditional PMF**: Probability given another variable's value

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**P**MF **P**robability **M**ust **F**ollow rules"
- PMF gives exact probabilities (not densities)
- Must sum to 1 (normalization property)
- Think of PMF as a "probability histogram"
- Conditional PMF = Joint / Marginal (just like Bayes' rule)

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Unnormalized Probabilities**: Model outputs don't sum to 1
- **Negative Probabilities**: Invalid probability values
- **Mixing PMF and PDF**: Using continuous formulas for discrete data
- **Independence Assumptions**: Wrong joint PMF calculations
- **Extrapolation Errors**: Using PMF outside its support

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Expectation

### 1. What is this concept?
The expected value (or mean) of a random variable is the average value you'd get if you repeated the experiment infinitely many times. It's the probability-weighted average of all possible outcomes.

### 2. Why does this exist?
- **Central Tendency**: Single number summarizing the "center" of a distribution
- **Decision Making**: Expected utility for optimal choices
- **Loss Functions**: Many ML loss functions are expectations (MSE, cross-entropy)
- **Performance Metrics**: Expected accuracy, precision, recall across data distribution

### 3. Where and when is this used in ML pipelines?
- **Loss Function Optimization**: Minimizing expected loss over training data
- **Model Evaluation**: Expected performance on test distribution
- **Ensemble Methods**: Expected prediction across multiple models
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Expected validation score
- **A/B Testing**: Expected conversion rates and confidence intervals

### 4. Full Formula:
```
Discrete Random Variable:
E[X] = Σ_x x × p_X(x)

Properties of Expectation:
1. Linearity: E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]
2. Constant: E[c] = c
3. Non-negative: If X ≥ 0, then E[X] ≥ 0
4. Bounded: If a ≤ X ≤ b, then a ≤ E[X] ≤ b

Law of Total Expectation:
E[X] = Σ_y E[X|Y = y] × P(Y = y)

Variance (second moment):
Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])²

For Functions of Random Variables:
E[g(X)] = Σ_x g(x) × p_X(x)

Common Expected Values:
- Bernoulli(p): E[X] = p
- Binomial(n,p): E[X] = np  
- Geometric(p): E[X] = 1/p
- Poisson(λ): E[X] = λ
```

**Term Breakdown**:
- **E[X]**: Expected value of X (also written as μ or μ_X)
- **p_X(x)**: PMF of X at value x
- **Linearity**: Expectation of sum = sum of expectations
- **Law of Total Expectation**: Conditional expectation rule
- **g(X)**: Function of random variable X

### 5. How to Remember this Formula:
**Memory Trick**: "**E**xpectation = **E**ach value × **E**ach probability"
- Think of expectation as "probability-weighted average"
- Linearity: E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y] (even if X and Y dependent!)
- For constants: "expectation of constant is the constant"
- Variance formula: "E[X²] - (E[X])²" = "mean of squares minus square of mean"

### 6. What goes wrong if I forget or misuse this?
❌ **Common ML Mistakes**:
- **Jensen's Inequality**: E[g(X)] ≠ g(E[X]) for non-linear g
- **Infinite Expectations**: Not checking if E[X] exists (e.g., Cauchy distribution)
- **Sample vs. Population**: Confusing sample mean with expected value
- **Independence Confusion**: E[XY] = E[X]E[Y] only if X and Y independent
- **Loss Function Errors**: Not accounting for class imbalance in expected loss

### 7. Python Example:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate expectation for discrete distribution
def calculate_expectation(values, probabilities):
    """Calculate E[X] = Σ x * P(X = x)"""
    return np.sum(values * probabilities)

# Example 1: Custom PMF
values = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
probabilities = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1])
expected_value = calculate_expectation(values, probabilities)
print(f"Expected value: {expected_value:.3f}")

# Example 2: ML Loss Function (Expected Loss)
def binary_cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """Expected cross-entropy loss"""
    return -np.mean(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))

# Simulate predictions
np.random.seed(42)
y_true = np.random.binomial(1, 0.3, 1000)
y_pred = np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.9, 1000)
expected_loss = binary_cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Expected cross-entropy loss: {expected_loss:.3f}")

# Example 3: A/B Testing Expected Conversion
# Control group: 5% conversion rate
# Treatment group: 7% conversion rate
control_conversion = 0.05
treatment_conversion = 0.07

# Expected revenue per user (assuming $100 per conversion)
revenue_per_conversion = 100
expected_revenue_control = control_conversion * revenue_per_conversion
expected_revenue_treatment = treatment_conversion * revenue_per_conversion

print(f"Expected revenue per user:")
print(f"Control: ${expected_revenue_control:.2f}")
print(f"Treatment: ${expected_revenue_treatment:.2f}")
print(f"Expected lift: ${expected_revenue_treatment - expected_revenue_control:.2f}")

# Example 4: Linearity of Expectation
X = np.random.poisson(3, 10000)  # E[X] = 3
Y = np.random.binomial(5, 0.4, 10000)  # E[Y] = 5 * 0.4 = 2

# E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y] (even though X and Y are independent)
print(f"E[X] ≈ {X.mean():.3f}")
print(f"E[Y] ≈ {Y.mean():.3f}")
print(f"E[X + Y] ≈ {(X + Y).mean():.3f}")
print(f"E[X] + E[Y] = {X.mean() + Y.mean():.3f}")
```
