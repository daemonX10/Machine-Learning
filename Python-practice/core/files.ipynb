    "The text you've provided, \"os basic commands\", seems to refer to the `os` module in Python, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality. Here are some basic commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing the module**: To use the `os` module, you first need to import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Getting the current working directory**: You can use `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(os.getcwd())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Changing the current working directory**: You can use `os.chdir(path)` to change the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    os.chdir('/path/to/your/directory')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Listing files and directories**: You can use `os.listdir(path)` to get a list of all files and directories in the specified directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(os.listdir('/path/to/your/directory'))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating a new directory**: You can use `os.mkdir(path)` to create a new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    os.mkdir('/path/to/your/new/directory')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Renaming a file or directory**: You can use `os.rename(src, dst)` to rename a file or directory from `src` to `dst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    os.rename('/path/to/old/name', '/path/to/new/name')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Removing a file**: You can use `os.remove(path)` to remove (delete) a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    os.remove('/path/to/the/file')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    os.rmdir('/path/to/the/directory')\n",

    "\n",
    "The `os` module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. Here are some more commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Checking if a path exists**: You can use `os.path.exists(path)` to check if a certain path exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if os.path.exists('/path/to/the/directory'):\n",
    "        print(\"Directory exists\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Directory does not exist\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Checking if a path is a file**: You can use `os.path.isfile(path)` to check if a certain path is a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if os.path.isfile('/path/to/the/file'):\n",
    "        print(\"It is a file\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"It is not a file\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Checking if a path is a directory**: You can use `os.path.isdir(path)` to check if a certain path is a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if os.path.isdir('/path/to/the/directory'):\n",
    "        print(\"It is a directory\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"It is not a directory\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Getting the size of a file**: You can use `os.path.getsize(path)` to get the size of a file in bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    size = os.path.getsize('/path/to/the/file')\n",
    "    print(f\"The size of the file is {size} bytes\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Joining paths**: You can use `os.path.join(path1, path2, ...)` to join one or more path components intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    full_path = os.path.join('/path/to/the/directory', 'file.txt')\n",
    "    print(full_path)  # Outputs: /path/to/the/directory/file.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Splitting a path**: You can use `os.path.split(path)` to split a pathname. The function returns `(head, tail)` where `tail` is the last pathname component and `head` is everything leading up to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    head, tail = os.path.split('/path/to/the/directory/file.txt')\n",
    "    print(head)  # Outputs: /path/to/the/directory\n",
    "    print(tail)  # Outputs: file.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Getting the file extension**: You can use `os.path.splitext(path)` to split the pathname path into a pair `(root, ext)` such that `root + ext == path`, and `ext` is empty or begins with a period and contains at most one period.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    root, ext = os.path.splitext('/path/to/the/file.txt')\n",
    "    print(root)  # Outputs: /path/to/the/file\n",
    "    print(ext)  # Outputs: .txt\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "The `shutil` module in Python provides high-level file operations. Here are some basic commands:\n",

    "1. **Copy a file**: You can use `shutil.copy(src, dst)` to copy the file `src` to the file or directory `dst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    shutil.copy('/path/to/source/file', '/path/to/destination')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Copy a directory**: You can use `shutil.copytree(src, dst)` to recursively copy an entire directory tree rooted at `src` to a directory named `dst` and return the destination directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    shutil.copytree('/path/to/source/directory', '/path/to/destination/directory')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Move a file or directory**: You can use `shutil.move(src, dst)` to move the file or directory `src` to `dst`.\n",

    "    shutil.rmtree('/path/to/the/directory')\n",

    "    shutil.make_archive('archive_name', 'zip', '/path/to/directory')\n",

    "    shutil.unpack_archive('archive.zip', '/path/to/extract/location')\n",
    "    ```\n",
